And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my <b title='the collection of information outside of a laboratory [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_research">Wiki</a>]'>field research</b>!

<i>Phoebe</i>Really? You think?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike, I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an <b title='â†—retarded, imbecile, moron'>idiot</b>! And that's something they should learn on their own!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window <b title='hit on - try to start a conversation with sb because you are sexually attracted to them â†—flirt, come on to'>hitting on</b> a girl) Joey, <b title='used for emphasis'>for God's sake</b>, go to work!

<i>Dr. Biely</i>Primarily in the <b title='[<a href="http://www.blackriverfossils.org/USA/SouthDakota/PennintgonCounty/tabid/53/TripReports/4058/Default.aspx">link</a>]'>Pierre Shale region</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota">Wiki</a>]'>South Dakota</b>.<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(shocked and <b title='â†—puzzled, bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>confused</b> by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")<br>
<i>Benjamin</i><b title='Would you care to - used for asking politely whether sb would like to do sth'>Care to</b> <b title='say or do sth in an uncertain way'>venture</b> a guess?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(annoyed) May 12th?<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>(looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many <b title='graduate student - a student with a first degree from a university who is studying or doing research at a more advanced level =postgraduate'>graduate students</b> you'd be needing?<br>
<i>Dr. Li</i>Half a dozen.<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>I see, and Dr. Biely?<br>
<i>Dr. Biely</i>Three for <b title='the process of digging in the ground to find things from the past'>excavation</b> and two for analysis.<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 <b title='an American girl group [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirelles">Wiki</a>]'>Shirelles</b> <b title='sth such as a song that is popular'>hit</b> was later <b title='cover - perform or record a song that was originally recorded by another artist'>covered</b> by a popular British invasion band?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students. <br>
<i>Benjamin</i>No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_It%27s_You">Wiki</a>]'>Baby It's You</b>". Baby It's You.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with <b title='the study of the history of the Earth using fossils'>paleontology</b>.<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>You're right, I apologize. <b title='remove a word from a piece of writing by drawing a line through it'>Scratch</b> the last question. Spell "<b title="apparently it's a kind of dinosaur">Boscodictiasaur</b>".<br>
<i>Ross</i>(annoyed) Um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>Yeah, I just <b title='make up - invent, think of'>made it up</b>. Spell it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title="â†—glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">stares</b> at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>But you are a liar.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What did I just say?<br>
(Joey comes out of his room)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You still here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am <b title='insult - offend sb by saying or doing sth they think is rude'>insulted</b>. When I tell somebody I did something...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you <b title='exactly'>right</b> there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then, you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some <b title='â†—remark'>comments</b>. <b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, now, remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only <b title='air - broadcast sth on the radio or on television'>aired</b> in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)<br>
<i>(The commercial</i>Joey says "<b title="'first' in Japanese">Ichiban</b>". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and <b title='smack - make a short loud noise with your lips, kiss loudly'>smacks</b> them saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says <b title='seduce - persuade sb to have sex with you â†—provocatively, entice, lure, tempt, suggestively'>seductively</b> "Ichiban... Lipstick For Men" and "<b title="'ultimate, the strongest, best' in Japanese">Saikyo</b>" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel are speechless.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door). <br>
(Silence)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He really is a chameleon.

<i>Rachel</i>(surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really <b title='settle - decide sth definitely'>settled</b> on a spot yet!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='honestly or in a sincere way'>genuinely</b> excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French <b title='a large printed notice, picture, or photograph'>poster</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title="angry and upset by sb's behavior or remarks">offended</b>) I like that poster!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?
<s>Ross' office. Ross is <b title='pace - walk first in one direction and then in another many times'>pacing</b> and Benjamin enters.</s>

(Benjamin enters)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margaret's pants size?<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie <b title='prevent sth from happening or developing in the correct way â†—meddle, intervene'>interfere with</b> the interview process.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Sarcastic) No! Stop!<br>
<i>Benjamin</i>Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='questioning â†—suspicious'>Skeptical</b>) Really?<br>

<i>Ross</i>I have to break up with Charlie?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>She climbs out of the frame, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a <b title='strange or frightening in a way that makes you think of ghosts'>spooky</b>, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.<br>
<i>Joey</i>GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!<br>
(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel <b title='grin - smile widely â†—smirk'>grins</b>. She then takes Gladys and enters Monica's apartment.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I know. Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to <b title='formally give sth to sb'>submit</b> you whether I think you are right for the part or not.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not the <b title='(main) idea/opinion/reason'>point</b> Chandler. The point is that you lied.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
<s>Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.</s>

<i>Charlie</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very <b title='morally good or correct'>ethical</b> man.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog">Wiki</a>]'>Underdog</b>"?<br>

<i>Ross</i>No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Benji?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Too little, too late, Benji!<br>

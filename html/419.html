<i>Emily</i>I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I packed in such a rush, I left my <b title="knickers - a piece of women's underwear worn between the waist and the top of the legs =panties">knickers</b> here.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I could ask her to live with me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you serious?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why not?! I mean, I mean why not?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because you've only known her for six weeks! Ok, I've got a carton of milk in my refrigerator I've had a longer relationship with!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna ask some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this <b title='very/by a large amount'>way</b> too soon, you're only gonna scare her!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't wanna do that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! You don't wanna <b title='spoil/ruin/damage'>wreck</b> it, you don't wanna go too fast!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>That's too hard. Too hard!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Otherwise I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.<br>

Didn't you ever read <b title='A science fiction short story and subsequent novel...

<i>Chandler</i><b title='an offensive expression used to show that you are very angry with sb'>Screw</b> the Knicks!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, just do it!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Op, op, I'm convinced!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm <b title='be or become involved in sth that is happening'>in</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what're you gonna bet?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, ok, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only one who's <b title='not supporting any of the sides involved in an argument =fair ≠biased'>impartial</b>, and she's so pretty.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Umm, ooh, ooh...oh, I have a game!<br>

<i>Monica</i>They're green?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good! Good! Five points!<br>
(They both <b title='feel or show great happiness '>rejoice</b>; Chandler is totally <b title='↗puzzled, bemused, perplexed, bewildered'>confused</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, Joey, same question.<br>
(He looks to Chandler, who doesn't have a clue.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! Uh, they're tall.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for <b title='having a lot of leaves ↗hairy, sweaty'>leafy</b>, leafy.<br>
(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didn't <b title='think of ↗occur to, hit on'>come up with</b> the answer.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>What? Shut up! We're winning!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fine, let's do it.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it would be.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.<br>

<i>Emily</i>Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life...you come to England.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't...you don't think there's any way?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future I'm I'm, and we were getting married or something.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Oh no, no, right, eh, I shouldn't 've said married. Uh, please don't get <b title='strange or unusual and a bit frightening'>freaky</b> on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, don't. Why don't we?<br>

<i>Emily</i>You are mad!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.<br>
<i>Emily</i>We've only known each other for six weeks!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Those were like the best seats ever.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? You know, kinda like a peace offering.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, that's very nice. <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b>, You know they were free and they're too small.<br>
(He knocks on the girls' door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using <b title='[<a href="Star Trek">Wiki</a>]'>Star Trek</b> technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow! Anyhow, Chandler is <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>, and Joey doesn't even realize it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I KNOW!!!<br>
(They both <b title='run very fast for a short distance ↗rush, dash'>sprint</b> to what used to be their apartment.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='open ↗hang up, wait up'>Open up</b>! Open up! Open up!<br>
(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>We'll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What the hell is going on?!<br>
(It's Rachel's turn to open the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Ok, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.<br>
(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.) Oh! Oh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We are switching back, right now!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, we're not! We're not leaving!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know. I don't-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Aw! I don't wanna move again!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole...you stole it...our apartment, we won that apartment <b title='honestly, without cheating'>fair and square</b>, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting it back right now!<br>
(They open the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. We <b title='thought'>figured</b> you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Let us keep the apartment, and- <br>
<i>Monica</i>As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.<br>
[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Totally worth it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That was one good minute!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Good night.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Good night.<br>
(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to close both sections of his door.)<br>
[Cut to the girls apartment.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Men are such <b title='imbecile, intelligence quotient'>idiots</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's so funny to think if you'd 've just done that right after the last contest, no one would've had to move at all.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, <b title='↗ornament, accessory'>scarf</b>'s done. (It's not really a scarf, it's just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on! Come on. Come on.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What-what's going on?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! <b title='Look at it'>Check it out</b>! This is unbelievable! Joey has been <b title='deliberately not breathe out for a short time'>holding his breath</b> for almost four minutes!<br>
(We see Joey who has <b title='become bigger by increasing the amount of air inside'>puffed up</b> his cheeks and Chandler <b title='behaving calmly and not seeming interested ↗casual, breezy'>nonchalantly</b> reaches down and <b title='pinch - squeeze sth between a finger and a thumb'>pinches</b> Joey's nose shut. In a few seconds, Joey has to move because he's now forced to actually hold his breath.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Chandler) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>! What're you- you trying to kill me?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering from her room) Pheebs, I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> ask you something.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh, what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, well since I'm moving out and-and you're so beautiful...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>...how about I move in with you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who's Denise?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>My <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You have a roommate?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes, Denise. Denise!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, what is with the <b title='a situation in which you keep sth secret ↗confidential, classified'>secrecy</b> Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, she <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know about?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>! DENISE!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Rach, listen, I was thinking uh, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> have an extra room over at my place...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, that's true.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We can like <b title='↗sit up'>stay up</b> late, talking, and watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursdays right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>!

<i>Phoebe</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, that. Umm, she <b title='take - accept'>took</b> it really well.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh. You didn't tell her, did you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course not, because you're in love with her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married 'cause she'd only get more upset. I-I just <b title='comfort - make sb feel better when they are sad or anxious ↗soothe, console, condolence'>comforted</b> her, as a friend.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What do you mean, comforted her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's also a sign of friendship.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, not in your case Lovey <b title='+ "son" to form a surname like Johnson, Wilson, Anderson, Jackson, Thompson, Robinson, Nelson, Richardson, Peterson, Watson [<a href="http://names.mongabay.com/most_common_surnames.htm">link</a>]'>Loverson</b>. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross's cookie.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(grabs back his cookie) It was a hug! Ok? A simple hug. I was a friend being a friend to a friend.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Use the word "friend" more. Just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?<br>
<i>Ross</i>S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ninety percent of a women's <b title='a chemical that an animal produces that spreads in the air and influences the behavior of other animals of the same type, such as by attracting them sexually [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_pheromones">Wiki</a>] ↗hormone'>pheromones</b> come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her <b title='so suprrised that you cannot speak ↗stunned'>dumbfounded</b>.) Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(taking his coffee) Ok, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(grabbing back his coffee) Ok, if the place you are referring to is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I didn't understand that, but you know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!<br>

But she was only using the magazine as a <b title='sb/sth that you use to trick sb into going somewhere or doing sth ↗diversion, distraction, bait'>decoy</b> because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of the cookie and drinks some of the coffee.)

<i>Joey</i>Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.<br>

<i>Joey</i>I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." <b title='short for "Jesus". used when you are very surprised or angry about sth ↗jee, gee, geez'>Jeez</b>! (Exits.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok listen, you know when you move in, Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we wanna do with it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure!<br>

Eh, whatever, you know, I haven't really thought about it that much.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well I like that idea. <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>Obviously</b>! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a, a game room, you know? I mean you can buy old <b title='a coin-operated entertainment machine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game">Wiki</a>]'>arcade games</b> like uh, like <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/SpaceInvaders-Gameplay.gif"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Wiki</a>]'>Space Invaders</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29">Wiki</a>]'>Asteroids</b> for $200, the real ones! The big-big-big ones!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok so you mean no as in, "<b title='used to express a reaction such as surprise or admiration'>Gee</b> Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it, before we reject it completely."<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I'm sorry. Of course- Yes, uh, interesting idea, umm, talked about it, but no.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, <b title='It has ended?'>that's it?</b><br>
<i>Monica</i>I just don't think that you know, arcade games <b title='fit'>go</b> in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do you have against the beautiful guest room?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nothing, I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody that we know, lives about 30 seconds away!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you <b title='mock - laugh at sb, often by copying them in an amusing but unkind way ↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mimic, simulate'>mocking</b> me?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid <b title='quarrel, argument'>fight</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But you're still moving in together, right? 'Cause my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah? I just <b title='thought'>figured</b> you know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, you know?

<i>Rachel</i>This one? (Picks it up.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It worked!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is A nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a <b title='sb considered abnormal ↗weirdo, psycho, creep, maniac'>freak</b>. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."<br>

<i>Ross</i>Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here's Warren's number.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him <b title='immediately / at the present time ↗just now, by now, right away'>right now</b>! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank you!<br>
(She hugs him and he starts to hug her back but notices the look Phoebe is giving him and pushes her away.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, you go call him!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I saw it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know what you're talking about.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You know, that you love her again; you re-love her!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I do not re-love her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't believe you won't just admit it! (Pause) Ok, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, we're just friends now! Ok? Why would I do anything stupid?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already <b title='sublet_sublet/subletted_sublet/subletted'>subletted</b>! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh-huh, hero, I uh, I don't know, well, all right.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just <b title='if a situation, argument etc blows up, it suddenly becomes important or dangerous'>blew up</b>! And that's how she <b title='end up - be in a particular situation, state, or place after a series of events'>ended up</b> living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Ok, that's a lie.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You don't have a roommate.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Hi.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah! Oh, yes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Totally!<br>
(They start thinking.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We don't have to <b title='think of'>come up with</b> this now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh good.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, you know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Changes?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> into the living room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're-you're-you're gonna bring the <b title='a type of recliner (a chair in which you can lean back at different angles) made in the U.S. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcalounger">Wiki</a>]'>Barcalounger</b> over here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is that a problem?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, it's just that they're a <b title='group of things'>set</b> and they should probably stay together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, that's <b title='used to say that you agree with sth, that you understand it, or that it does not annoy you'>cool</b>. Then I'll just uh, bring 'em both over.<br>
<i>Monica</i>See now-now you're taking them away from their home.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I <b title='understand'>get</b> it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and <b title='leave to go to another place ↗take off'>head off</b> to work!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah-yeah, you know what? Yeah, <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>, that's it, everything will be mine!

<i>Rachel</i>But you know what, if you think it's gonna be ok we'll just <b title='think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>work out</b> a system. You know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a <b title='a small frame for hanging clothes such as jackets and shirts '>hanger</b> on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm getting lucky." (Laughs.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I-I didn't think of that.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is once again being dragged in by Ross so he that he can try to manipulate the situation so that it's best for Ross, <b title='possibly, but not certainly'>not necessarily</b> what's best for Monica and Chandler.</s>
<i>Ross</i>So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!<br>
(They both start laughing at him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's very funny!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I-I-I'm serious, ok? I mean, think about it. You move in, uh, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing you know, you <b title='↗dump'>break up</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, you were right <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>, it was just a stupid fight about a room.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, there are no stupid fights! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room... represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel's room) could destroy you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'm not so worried.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, no, me neither.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine! It's your life! (Starts to storm out <b title='↗madly, frantically, hysterically'>mad</b> about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just don't wanna see you guys break up! You know? Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON'T DO IT! (Finally leaves.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You still wanna move in together right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Of course!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross didn't scare you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come here, I'm gonna show you something!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
(They run to the living room where Monica has moved the chair back (Towards the step), the coffee table forward (Towards the TV), and taped a square outline on the floor.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God! <b title='A chalk outline is a temporary outline drawn on the ground outlining evidence at a crime scene. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk_outline">Wiki</a>]'>Someone's killed Square Man</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is where I thought the Barcalounger could <b title='be usually kept or put in a particular place'>go</b>! You see you could see the TV and still it's walking distance to the kitchen.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>! I wanna show you something too!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about, you know, dating other guys.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home <b title='completely'>all</b> <b title='if you feel weepy, you want to cry'>weepy</b> and you'll be telling her, "Oh that's ok.

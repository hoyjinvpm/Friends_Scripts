<i>Chandler</i>Hey you guys!<br>
<i>Ross and Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, what do you think?<br>
<i>Ross</i>About what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you kidding? Ok, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I got glasses!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, you-you always had glasses.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No I didn't!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, <b title='a dark red color / a type of wine from Burgundy ↗crimson, cardinal, scarlet'>burgundy</b>, and they made you look kind of umm...<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='having the qualities or appearance considered characteristic of women ↗masculine'>Feminine</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course! (She <b title='mouth - form words with your mouth but not make any sound'>mouths</b>, "I have no idea," to the rest of the <b title='group of people'>gang</b>.)

<i>Phoebe</i>So what do you guys want for an engagement present?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's ok Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='deprive sb/sth of sth - prevent sb/sth from enjoying or using sth'>deprive them of</b> that joy.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, I know I what I want!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What we want honey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no, you don't want this. You know, I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-huh, yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never <b title='↗let go, spill the beans, classified, confidential, vault, safe'>let out</b> of our family?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Dying people say the craziest things.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I wanted it for years! I was <b title='going to'>gonna</b> make cookies for my children.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Break my heart- Oh all right.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. I'm gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate <b title='piece ↗bit'>chip</b> cookies.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) <b title='used by sailors for calling to people on other ships'>Ahoy</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! How's the boat?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great! I'm really <b title='get into - enjoy'>getting into</b> this sailing <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, so you finally took it out of the <b title='a small harbor for small boats that are used for leisure ↗quay, pier, jetty, wharf'>marina</b> huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just <b title='kind of'>kinda</b>, sit, <b title='wait or spend time somewhere, doing nothing ↗hang out'>hang around</b>, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know, Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You could?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your own boat?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My <b title='a small horse ↗ponytail, pigtail, plait'>pony</b> was sick.

<i>Chandler</i>You know what I was thinking?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what're you doing tonight?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh why, do you have a lecture?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then <b title='completely free to do what you want and without any worries'>free as a bird</b>. <b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Ross</i>Um, my dad wanted to know if you want to play <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racquetball">Wiki</a>] ↗squash'>racquetball</b> with us.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah and he didn't really <b title='↗look for, send for'>ask for</b> you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, did-did you correct him?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is so cool, maybe this is something you could do every week.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. Or you can sit with him on the front <b title='an open area with a floor and a roof, attached to the lower level of a house ↗patio, balcony, terrace'>porch</b> and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, <b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b>, you-you have to let him win.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>He <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hates</b> to lose.<br>

<i>Ross</i>You're not a <b title='sb who is left-handed. -y - having a quality'>lefty</b>?<br>

(Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and <b title='exhale - breathe air etc out of your mouth'>exhales</b> <b title='exasperated - very annoyed and upset'>exasperatedly</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's wrong Phoebe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and that stupid fire <b title='burn_burned/burnt_burned/burnt'>burned</b> it <b title='used after certain verbs to show that sth is completely finished, used, or removed ↗use up'>up</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nooo! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a <b title='-proof - used to describe sth which cannot easily be affected or damaged by sb/sth ↗childproof, waterproof, bulletproof'>fireproof</b> box and keep it at least a hundred <b title='yard ~ 0.9m; pound ~ 九两'>yards</b> away from the original?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(pauses as she <b title='figure out - think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figures out</b> how to answer that) Because I'm normal! That was the one <b title='money or property that you arrange for sb to have after you die =inheritance ↗heirloom, will'>legacy</b> my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an <b title='an agreement between two people to marry ↗propose'>engagement</b> present.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't worry about it Pheebs.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No one got me an engagement present.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok here, I don't have the recipe, but... here, I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic <b title='{TM - trademark} a clear plastic bag used for keeping food in so that it stays fresh'>Baggie</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>An old cookie?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) This is what happens when you don't <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_registry">Gift registry</a>]'>register for gifts</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See no, I-I made a <b title='a quantity of food etc that is produced or prepared at the same time'>batch</b> and I froze it, and this is the only one left.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We can't accept this.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Because'>'Cause</b> it's <b title='disgusting'>gross</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! Wait! I think I can <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figure out</b> the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah! <b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> I can do it.<br>
(Chandler looks over and sees Ross <b title='↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance'>glaring</b> at them.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, Ross, we owe you a present.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Two! I've been engaged twice!

<i>Rachel</i>That is the Coast Guard.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What're they doing out here? Coast's all the way over there. (Points to the coast, <b title='in the meantime'>meanwhile</b> there is coast behind him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, I'm just gonna go over the basic <b title='point - essential aspect of sth'>points</b> for one more time, are you ready?<br>

<i>Monica</i>All right, I definitely taste <b title='a spice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaiphar">Wiki</a>]'>nutmeg</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You don't? (Laughs) Well, that's the difference between a professional and a <b title='sb who is not trained to a high or professional standard in a particular subject ≠expert ↗pro, veteran, rookie, amateur'>layman</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That and <b title="behavior that shows that you think you are better or more important than other people ↗snobbish, condescend, smug, patronize">arrogance</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! How was sailing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't wanna talk about it. You know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what's left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)<br>
<i>Monica and Phoebe</i>No-wait-no-hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='recoil - move quickly back'>recoils</b> in horror) Women are <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b>! (Storms out.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't believe that! Look now the only thing that's left of my grandmother's legacy is this <b title='a very small piece of dry food ↗crumble, crumple'>crumb</b>. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering with Chandler) Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! How was it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were <b title='bond - develop a special relationship with sb'>bonding</b>. He even said that I can call him dad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And what did he ask you not to call him?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used esp by children or when speaking to children'>Daddy</b>. All right look, here's the story. (<b title='a scene in a film, play, book etc that shows sth that happened before that point in the story'>Flashback</b> to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we've just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it's really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that's when it happened.<br>
[Cut to the flashback, Chandler's no longer doing the <b title='↗narrate, dub, subtitle'>voice-over</b>.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Guys?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Have a seat <b title='used by an older person as a way to address a boy or young man'>son</b>.

<i>Monica</i>Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You gave my father a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lap_dance">Wiki</a>]'>lap dance</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why do they put so much steam in there?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh otherwise they'd have to call it, the room room.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why? Ok? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on, <b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>it's not that big a deal</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not that big a deal? There... there was touching of things.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was really funny; he'll be telling this story for years!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't want him to tell this story for years.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_camp">Weight loss camp</a>]'>fat camp</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I wasn't escaping.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Then how did you get caught in the <b title='a type of steel fencing wire constructed with short sharp points on it'>barbed wire</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I was trying to <b title='help'>help out</b> a <b title='↗chipmunk, rodent'>squirrel</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You were trying to eat it!<br>
(The phone rings.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is <b title='if an event which has been arranged is off, it will not now take place ↗cancel, postpone'>off</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) I'm sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Ok, I'll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)

<i>Chandler</i>(getting up) All right, I'm <b title='↗take off, see off'>off</b> to see your dad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little overdressed?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he <b title='tip - give sb tip'>tips</b> you this time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I <b title='thought'>figured</b> I would try to <b title='↗talk into'>convince</b> him not to tell the story anymore, and I figured the best way to do that was <b title='↗in person'>face to face</b>. And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Rachel) Hey, are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well hello! So, when are we getting back out on the water <b title='used by men for talking in a friendly or threatening way to other men'>matey</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Because! You're mean on the boat!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? I was just trying to teach you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, lesson <b title='learn_learned/learnt_learned/learnt'>learned</b>! Rachel is mean!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me <b title='help'>help out</b> at all.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three <b title='life jacket - sth you wear on a boat to make you float if you fall into the water by accident'>life jackets</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> tell <b title='you'>ya</b> something. That was not mean. Ok, my father, is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a really good teacher.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer <b title='sb who is not very intelligent ↗bonehead, doofus, dork, moron, imbecile, retarded'>pinhead</b>!?"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the <b title='a long pole on a boat that is attached to the bottom of a sail'>boom</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, you know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to <b title='tone down - make sth less severe'>tone it down</b> and uh stop yelling.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You won't <b title='tell people to do things ↗bossy'>boss</b> me around anymore?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I won't boss you around.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And you'll be nice?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And I'll be nice.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And you'll be <b title="not wearing clothes on the upper part of one's body">topless</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And- Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Do you want me to learn?!
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes. Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange <b title='the skin of some fruits and vegetables'>peel</b>, but no nutmeg.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Let's <b title='try it. shot - attempt'>give it a shot</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.<br>

<i>Monica</i>The ones we had <b title='exactly/immediately'>right</b> after you almost <b title='throw up - vomit ↗nauseous, sick, retch, gag'>threw up</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (<b title='make a noise when air from your stomach passes out through your mouth ↗belch, fart, sneeze'>Burps</b> a little bit.) I'm ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work <b title='from'>off</b> those.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn't like it.) It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, Joey, honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Right?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='No'>Nope</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's left sweetie, but that's ok, that's a <b title='difficult ↗tricky'>tough</b> one.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know why you just don't say left.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, go to the left. (Joey goes <b title='↗stern, bow'>starboard</b> or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(yelling) Just sit over there! (Points to the port side.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(hurrying over) Ok! Ok, you're yelling at me again! <b title='Notice'>See</b> that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, you know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Joey, come on! We just <b title='go over - repeat, review'>went over</b> this! (She does it instead.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, oh, you know what, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was <b title='disgusting'>gross</b>!<br>

<i>Joey</i>All right <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, wait did I- I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don't quit?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not <b title='notice that sth is likely to happen, esp sth bad'>see this coming</b>. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.

<i>Joey</i>Hey, I did learn.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Come on.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Awww...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, it's ok. I know what a main sail is. (Points to it. It's the larger sail.) I know, I know to <b title='lower your head or body very quickly'>duck</b> when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Left.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Damn it!

<i>Ross</i>What are we gonna do with all these cookies? (thinks) Joey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother really happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-looking up at us and smiling <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Looking up?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah. No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell <b title='certainly/definitely'>for sure</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.

<i>Ross</i>Aww, Pheeb, come on, isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula is <b title='used to say that you are determined not to allow sth to happen ↗no way'>over my dead body</b>. And that's not happening <b title='=till, until'>'til</b> October 15th, 2032.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>That's what you think.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, you know I-I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Neselé Tolouse.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What was her name?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Neselé Toulouse.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='The chocolate chip cookie was accidentally developed by Ruth Graves Wakefield in 1930. She owned the Toll House Inn...

<i>Phoebe</i>(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes! (Realizes.) Ohh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you're burning in hell!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. You know, I'm a little... I'm a little embarrassed about it.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I understand <b title='totally'>completely</b>, there's nothing more <b title='↗scare, frighten, terrify'>horrifying</b> than embarrassing yourself in front of your <b title='relatives by marriage ↗mother-in-law, sister-in-law'>in-laws</b>. <b title='used when adding more details about what you have just said'>As a matter of fact</b>, when I started <b title='date - have a romantic relationship with sb'>dating</b> Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me <b title='what I did as a job ↗live on/off'>what I did for a living</b> and I told him I was a lawyer.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hmm, what-what did you do when they found out?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>They never did, so if you <b title='at any time'>ever</b> see me giving them legal advice just nod <b title='together'>along</b>. Shall we?<br>
(Chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their <b title='robe - bathrobe'>robes</b>. Only Chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. You see this is a <b title='including (students of) both sexes =mixed'>coed</b> whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and Chandler didn't seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here!

<i>Rachel</i>Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh we're not sailing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Just pull on it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. (She does so and it brings the <b title='coolbox'>cooler</b> closer together.) Hey-hey-hey! (Sees what's in the cooler.) Sandwiches!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What else?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(hands him one) <b title='Here you are'>Here you go</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What you- don't hold it like that! You're letting all the good stuff fall out.<br>
(More falls out.)<br>

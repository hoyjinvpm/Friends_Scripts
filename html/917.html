<s>Ross' apartment, Chandler and Joey enter.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! You ready to go?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah, let me just finish this.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Ross, <b title='look at this'>check this out</b>! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, have you seen this? It's a new <b title='the former students of a school, college etc'>alumni</b> website for college! It's cool! You-you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're <b title='occupied with, engaged in'>up to</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's-it's actually <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> interesting to find out what people are doing... uh remember Andrea Rich?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That tall girl that wouldn't sleep with you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-huh, uh-huh... well, her Internet company <b title='go under - stop operating because of financial problems ↗shut down'>went under</b> and she lost an ear in a boating accident...<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to say you are sure about sth'>Bet</b> she'd sleep with you now.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='no'>Nah</b>, I already e-mailed her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me see what you wrote about yourself, "Doctor of <b title='the study of fossils'>Paleontology</b>, two kids..." (pause) Wait a second, you split with Carol because you have different interests? I think you split with Carol because you've <b title='women'>one very similar interest</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok! (he throws the basketball against a table again)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(he picks up the ball) What, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes?! (he enters another room)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(he comes back) Alright, let's go!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, I think you made it clear you can't be trusted with the ball inside the house!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! How was basketball?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, it was a lot of fun, yeah, <b title='exactly'>right</b> <b title='used for stating the end of a period of time'>up</b> until Chandler got a finger in the eye!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, no! Who did that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler. Hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's <b title='a crib for a baby to sleep in ↗camp bed, cradle, bassinet, carrycot, stroller, pushchair'>cot</b>) Uh Rach, what's Hugsy doing in the crib with Emma? (he looks <b title='confused ↗bewildered, bemused'>puzzled</b>)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, she was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(still very puzzled) Oh, of course... yeah... it's a, stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey... are you-you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rachel, let's be clear on this, ok? I did not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right... Oh, Emma loves him!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, why-why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh hey Phoebe... how you doing? You feeling better?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Breaking up <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>! Oh, I really miss Mike!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I'm so sorry!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh God, I've tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that <b title='if two words or lines of poetry rhyme, they end with a similar sound ↗cat, hat, rat'>rhymes</b> with AARRGGHH!!<br>
<i>Monica</i>God, I so know how you feel. Aw, <b title='↗dump'>breaking up</b> with Richard was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. (<b title='spot - notice'>Spotting</b> Chanler <b title='↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>stares</b> at her) All right fine, I'll put another dollar in the Richard jar.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Monica, I'm gonna need your help <b title='get through - manage to deal with a difficult situation'>getting through</b> this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're not gonna need my help?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well no, when I <b title='arrive at'>get to</b> the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mimic, simulate'>mocking</b> jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, <b title='because'>'cause</b> I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... <b title='failry/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna <b title='want to'>wanna</b> see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, <b title='You will get what you want'>you got it</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... <b title='=all right'>Alright</b> so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? Alright, that's what you want.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That was a test and you just failed.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Damn it! <b title='↗veteran, pro, amateur'>Rookie</b> mistake!<br>
(Ross enters and he's really angry. He goes towards Chandler who's sitting at the counter)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I believe I read that somewhere!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Not only it is not funny, it's' physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long<b title='penis'>...</b> (pause) It's not funny!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗I beg to differ with you, excuse me'>I respectfully disagree</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who cares? Nobody reads those things.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh? You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't have a page.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!
<s>Joey's room. Joey is sleeping.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Huggsy? Huggsy? (Wakes up) I want my penguin.<br>
[Rachel's room. Rachel and Emma are sleeping; Joey <b title='sneak - move somewhere quietly and secretly ↗sneaker, stealth'>sneaks</b> in and approaches the crib.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>(in his mind) Look at you, all <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> and <b title='not very experienced concerning life and the bad things people do ↗naive, sophisticated'>innocent</b>, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's <b title='slightly fat'>chubby</b> little hands wrapped around <b title='you'>ya</b>. (he picks up Hugsy) It's ok, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(threatening Joey with a <b title='a small circular piece of rubber covered loosely with cloth, which is used for holding hair together in a ponytail'>scrunchy</b>) Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's ok, it's ok Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I heard Emma <b title='stir - move slightly'>stirring</b>, so, so I came in to make sure she could reach Hugsy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, <b title='because of sth, as the result of sth'>now that</b> I'm <b title='not in bed'>up</b> I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(placing Hugsy back in the crib) Ok, <b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb ↗here you go'>there you go</b> sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over!
<s>Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is looking at the screen of his laptop, shaking his head.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) "<b title='↗as merry as the day is long - very happy and carefree'>gay as the day is long</b>"?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But it's clearly a joke. This <b title='used to say that sth is possible or is very likely to happen'>could easily</b> be true. (Phone rings)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Would you get that please? People've been calling to congratulate me all day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. Well I guess I should've known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch <b title='a 2001 musical film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge!#Plot">Wiki</a>] <img src="215px-Moulin_rouge_poster-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Moulin_rouge_poster.jpg/215px-Moulin_rouge_poster.jpg">'>Moulin Rouge</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!

<i>Monica</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you'll see my friend.<br>
[Time lapse, still Chandler and Monica's, but only Chandler is there. Enters Ross]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(visibly upset) I'm dead?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(faking sympathy) And so young.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, how you died was funny.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh <b title='used to say you think sb has said sth silly'>please</b>, hit by a <b title='airship <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Goodyear-blimp.jpg/350px-Goodyear-blimp.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blimp">Wiki</a>] ↗Zeppelin, Chernov'>blimp</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It kills over one Americans every year.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Unbelievable, my <b title='↗playmate, roommate, teammate'>classmates</b> are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're <b title='mess with - deceive'>messing with</b> people's feelings here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should've heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to <b title='an island in the Straits of Florida [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Florida_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Florida_in_United_States.svg/270px-Florida_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Key West</b>!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, God, I wish Mike were here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?<br>
(Phoebe gives her a <b title='with a clear meaning'>meaningful</b> look)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> call him. Just-just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, that's how it starts.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh God. (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>It does?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! And I think she really likes him because you know what he smells like you, and she, she loves that. <b title='try to figure it out. figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>Go figure</b>.

<i>Manny</i>Oh yeah, yeah, thank God you were here to <b title='watch sth in order to check that it works or happens in the way it should =supervise ↗overlook, overhear'>oversee</b> all the kissing!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You didn't hear the speech!<br>
<i>Manny</i>I've heard the speech: (in a mocking voice) "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her..."<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, it was very <b title='making you feel emotional ↗touching'>moving</b>! You're just heartless!<br>
<i>Manny</i>You're weak!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're... weird!<br>
<i>Manny</i>Your pants are undone!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)<br>
<i>Manny</i>(looking at the sofa) Where'd they go?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, damn it!<br>
<i>Manny</i>Oh we <b title='blow it - completely fail a task ↗screw up'>blew it</b>. I blame myself.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And I blame you too.
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment.</s>
<i>Ross</i>It's been an hour and not one of my <b title='↗roommate, playmate, teammate'>classmates</b> has <b title='show up - arrive in a place'>shown up</b>! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously <b title='if the soul of a dead person haunts a place, it appears there often'>haunted</b>!<br>
(Someone knocks on the door)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>There you go</b>! Someone came!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok! I'm-I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first <b title='mourn - feel extremely sad because sb has died'>mourner</b>! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)<br>
(Chandler and Monica go open the door)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi, glad you could come.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(in a mournful voice) Please come in.<br>
<i>Tom</i>Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I-I was in your class.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.<br>
<i>Tom</i>Thanks... uh... I'm-I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who is he?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used when you are talking about sb/sth that you do not know, remember, or understand, or when you think it does not matter ↗this'>Some</b> guy, Tom Gordon.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't remember him, but then again I <b title="touch - affect sb's emotions">touched</b> so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, did you know Ross well?<br>
<i>Tom</i>Oh, actually I <b title='hardly, scarcely'>barely</b> knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. you know if he's <b title='see - have a romantic relationship with ↗date, go out, ask out'>seeing</b> anyone?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.<br>
<i>Tom</i>What? You... You... Oh! Oh, can I ask you a personal question? How-how do you shave your beard so <b title='being near the surface; short'>close</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! <b title='we go here'>Here we go</b>, bye-bye! (he <b title='shove - push with force ↗stick, escort'>shoves</b> him out the door)<br>
<i>Tom</i>All right, all right (before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I look like a man?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!<br>
<i>Ross</i>This isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the website everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, you're right. Still, somebody must've seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an <b title='effect, influence'>impact</b> on anyone?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that <b title='be considered/included/important/valuable'>count for</b> something?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗doubtful, dubious, quizzical, suspicious, questioning, skeptical'>sceptical</b>) Yeah... (Someone knocks on the door) Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)<br>
(Chandlers opens the door. A beautiful woman stands at the doorway.)<br>
<i>Kori</i>Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Kori? Kori Weston?<br>
<i>Kori</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! You look amazing!<br>
<i>Kori</i>And you are?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Chandler, Chandler Bing. And I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You are married though.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)<br>
<i>Kori</i>I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I didn't know Ross and you were so close.<br>
<i>Kori</i>Oh we weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening <b title='intent - giving all your attention to sth ↗closely'>intently</b>.<br>
<i>Kori</i>I thought so many times about calling him and <b title='ask out - ask sb to go to a movie, a restaurant etc with you'>asking him out</b>. I guess I really missed my chance.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(he bounds into the <b title='living room'>lounge room</b>) But you didn't! I'm still alive!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who did we <b title='↗grave, graveyard, cemetery, tombstone, RIP (Rest in Peace)'>bury</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Kori, I-I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really <b title="make one's day - cause to be esp enjoyable or rewarding">made my day</b>! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than-than if this room were filled with people!<br>
<i>Kori</i>You sick <b title='sb who is considered to be very strange =weirdo ↗creep'>freak</b>, who does that? I can't believe I had a <b title='a feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!
<s>Ross' apartment.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(on the phone) No, <b title='=mom'>mum</b>, I am not dead. No, I know it's not something to kid about. Oh. Anyway, it was just a <b title='a trick that is intended to give sb a surprise or shock, or to make them look stupid'>practical joke</b> between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left <b title='without issue'>childless</b>. (pause) Monica?<br>

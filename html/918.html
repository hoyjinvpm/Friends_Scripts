<i>Joey</i>Monica, hey, can I borrow the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche">Wiki</a>]'>Porsche</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='=all right'>Alright</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>But ehm...what is it not?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='embarrassed, ashamed'>abashed</b>) A place to entertain my lady friends.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And what else is it not?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(even more abashed) A place to eat <b title='a long, thin, cylindrical pasta of Italian and Sicilian origin [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti">Wiki</a>] ↗macaroni, lasagne'>spaghetti</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it for anyway?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh well, the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball">Wiki</a>]'>powerball lottery</b> is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! So you're driving up to <b title='the southernmost state in the northeastern region of the United States known as New England [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Connecticut_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Connecticut_in_United_States.svg/270px-Connecticut_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Connecticut</b>?<br>

<i>Joey</i>Uh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we <b title='could use - would really like to have sth'>could really use</b> 300 million dollars.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No, thank you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey will you get me tickets too?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all <b title='join others and pay part of the money towards sth ↗chip in'>pitch in</b> 50 <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>, we'll <b title='↗combine'>pool</b> our money together <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> if we win, we'll split it!<br>
<i>Everyone</i>(almost <b title='simultaneous - happening or being done at exactly the same time'>simultaneously</b> except Ross) Yeah thats a great idea!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No thanks!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> win the lottery?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(in a <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mimic, simulate'>mocking</b> voice) Uh...sure I do, I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to <b title='an American aviation pioneer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart">Wiki</a>] ↗The Wright brothers, Howard Hughes'>Amelia Earhart</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Still <b title='engaged in or involved with, assigned to or working at'>on</b> Amelia Earhart?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The woman just <b title='vanish - suddenly disappear'>vanished</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! Do-do you know what your <b title='↗chance, probability, likelihood'>odds</b> are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I like those odds!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such <b title='a bunch of things is a number of things, esp a large number'>a bunch of</b> boohaki.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looking around at the others) I'll ask. (To Ross) Boohaki?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah so get ready to hear a lot of ehm...<b title='↗bullshit'>boohaki</b>, <b title='↗gosh, darn it'>goshdarnit</b> and <b title='↗mother fucker'>brotherpucker</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How do you know she's gonna start talking?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='kind of'>Kinda</b> like Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(who wasn't paying attention) What's that now?
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica, Chandler, Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen.</s>
<i>Monica</i>God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pie eating contest?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I saw a picture of you covered in <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Blueberry_Macro_2.JPG/220px-Blueberry_Macro_2.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry">Wiki</a>]'>blueberries</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(smiling) That was a good day!<br>
(Suddenly Ross comes running into the apartment)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(yelling to Monica) They're <b title='tow - pull a vehicle or ship along behind another vehicle'>towing</b> your car, they're towing your car!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm parked in a garage on <b title='A hamlet (very small village), formerly "East Kendall" and "Clarks Corners," located on the border of Monroe County (a county located in the U.S. state of New York).'>Morton</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='pant - breathe quickly with short noisy breaths'>panting</b>) They're towing A car. And I am seeing...spots.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sounding <b title='very nervous and anxious ↗-y, panicking, panicked'>panicky</b>) Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, relax! <b title='only a short time ago'>Just</b> my mother <b title='pick up - go and meet sb/sth, and take them somewhere (usu in a car)'>picked her up</b> two hours ago. You were there!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(not yelling anymore) I was?<br>
<i>Racel</i>Yes and you talked to her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I did?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She dropped off a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Makaronilaatikko.jpg/220px-Makaronilaatikko.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casserole">Wiki</a>] ↗stew'>casserole</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah! The casserole lady.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Ross) Hey! So, did you <b title='visit ↗drop by, stop by'>come by</b> to watch us win the big bucks?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, uh... and then I <b title='thought'>figured</b> after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with <b title='an imaginary evil spirit ↗goblin'>gremlins</b> dancing on top of it!<br>
(Phone starts ringing and Chandler comes running out of the bathroom)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='in a state of uncontrolled excitement, anger, or panic'>hysterical</b>) Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Monica) Do you think he washed his hands?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(into receiver) Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Monica) What's going on?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his <b title='↗commercial'>ad</b> agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh! <b title='difficult'>Tough</b> odds!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcasticlly</b>) Yeah <b title='used to express a strong wish'>if only</b> it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Yeah, look who's <b title='come around - change your opinion so that you now agree with sb or are no longer angry with them'>coming around</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(still on the phone) Damn it. Alright call me when you know more.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(excited) Did you get it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>One of the slots got filled.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Still excited) By you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sense the tone! No, that kid Nate got it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> that guy! I mean come on kid! <b title='[<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=hip+hop+pants">Hip hop pants</a>]'>Pull up your pants</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, there's two spots left right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.<br>
(Phoebe enters)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(excited) Hey you guys! Ok, you're not gonna believe this! I just saw my <b title='sb who has mysterious powers, esp the ability to receive messages from dead people or to know what will happen in the future ↗crystall ball, predict, forecast, psycho'>psychic</b> and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furcula#In_popular_culture">Wiki</a>]'>wishbone</b> home from work.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(mockingly) A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, who wants to do it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh can I? <b title='sb who never eats meat or fish'>Vegetarians</b> never <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just <b title='because'>'cause</b> we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the <b title='carcass - the body of a dead animal ↗corpse, corpus'>carcasses</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. Ey, Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, <b title="No thanks [<a href='http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091027113011AAnRBrW'>Yahoo! Answers</a>]">I'm good</b>, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'll do it! <b title="Apparently he didn't use cutlery (fork, knife, spoon). ↗crockery (cup, dish, plate)">It'll get the casserole stink off mine</b>.<br>
(Phoebe and Joey both grab one side of the wishbone)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I hope I win!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Right! But we know what you're wishing for!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't really say! Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(slightly <b title='feeling annoyed and impatient'>irritated</b>) I'm not really comfortable with these questions!<br>
<i>Rachel, Chandler and Monica</i>Please, just do it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, get ready, one, two, three!<br>
(they break the wishbone)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I won, hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Um, you know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys- just in case, maybe a <b title='a magical creature in old Arabian stories that will do what you want when you call it ↗Aladdin, Jefar, Jasmine, Abu, Sultan [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jafar_%28Aladdin%29#Aladdin">Wiki</a>]'>genie</b> will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah! That thing gets hot!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> win?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, you're not gonna win.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the <b title='a large piece of land surrounded on three sides by water'>cape</b>" and you're gonna, you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll 've to meet you guys up there, I gotta <b title='put gas (petrol) in a car'>gas up</b> the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai">Wiki</a>]'>Hyundai</b>."<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I've <b title='[<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111220172939AAe6vKi">Why does my voice sound different on a recording</a>]'>heard myself on tape</b> and I sound nothing like that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can see the <b title='the title of a newspaper report'>headline</b> now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why would I eat my own arm?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because I know, I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You don't have to do that, I mean I'll-I'll pay for myself. But, just the fact that you-you want me to have fun with you guys, that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>! Come here (they kiss and <b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle, snuggle'>hug</b>)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Get a room!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, so <b title='because of sth, as a result of sth'>now that</b> you're in, what're you gonna do if we win?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, I'll <b title='↗possibly'>probably</b> just invest it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ooh! Calm down...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and <b title='waste'>piss</b> it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all our money and buy the <b title='a professional basketball team [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knicks">Wiki</a>]'>Knicks</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't really care about the Knicks.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, you will when I <b title='choose, select'>pick</b> you as <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions">Basketball positions</a>] Frontcourt (forwards and center)'>starting forward</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='feeling happy and grateful because of what sb has done ↗move - make sb feel strong emotions'>touched</b>) You would do that? I never get picked!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?<br>
(pause)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looks around) <b title="I'll ask him again (like the 'boohaki' question)">I'll take this one too</b> (to Ross) Uh... Mommy?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I've <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oooh, I like that, "Daddy" (in a sexy tone)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I... I was just talking about Rachel.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna <b title='hit on the ass ↗smack, slap'>spank</b> me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(tries to be sexy too) Well <b title='used to say that you cannot give a definite answer to sth because your answer will be affected by sth else'>that depends</b>... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.<br>
(Phone rings, Chandler picks up)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello? Hello? Hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? What? Susan got it? How? Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>, I would've slept with him! Alright, bye. (hangs up)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb ↗pal, buddy, fella, man'>Dude</b>, I'm <b title='feeling sympathy/pity'>sorry</b>. But hey, there's one spot left, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's the boss's son.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on, lottery! (everybody cheers)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, oh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, alright, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>. So, we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this, we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, I have another idea!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, idea time is over.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What about the ones you have on the <b title='bedside table'>nightstand</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>There are no tickets on the nightstand!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.<br>
(Rachel get <b title='thinking that sb might be guilty of doing sth wrong or dishonest'>suspicious</b>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-huh, no you didn't! You must be <b title='wrong'>mistaken</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, sense the tone!!<br>
(Rachel comes out of their bedroom waving tickets)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, well, well, look what mommy found!<br>
(everyone's <b title='↗dumbfounded, dumbstruck, stunned'>shocked</b>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, fine! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh! The psychic also said that I would be <b title='↗betrayl'>betrayed</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!<br>
<i>Ross</i>3 minutes ago! I don't know why that's important...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey look, I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you <b title='used to emphasize sth that is unexpected or surprising in what you are saying'>even</b> get those?<br>
<i>Monica</i>When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Ross) I'll show you how.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets wins? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>Please</b>... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-<b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/NCI_Visuals_Food_Muffins.jpg/250px-NCI_Visuals_Food_Muffins.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin">Wiki</a>]'>muffins</b> last week we couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ahhh! (shocked)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me finish... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so <b title='fuck'>screw</b> you, the tickets are ours! (takes tickets from Rachel)<br>
<i>Monica</i>There's the man I married!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, believe me. If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their <b title='Though cosmetic or aesthetic (connected with beauty) surgery is the best-known kind of plastic surgery, most plastic surgery is not cosmetic [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery">Wiki</a>]'>plastic surgery</b> so they'd look just like you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(surprised) Alright, you know what? <b title='used to say that sth has ended / used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>That's it</b>! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And <b title='a former World No. 1 German tennis player [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf">Wiki</a>]'>Steffi Graf</b>, hah hah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Then I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-<b title='the amount of profits, crops etc that sth produces. The higher the yield, the higher the risk'>yield</b> bond.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you guys! We gotta keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my car to buy them!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, that's it! Just give <b title='them'>'em</b> to me! I'll split them up! (she tries to <b title='grab'>snatch</b> the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she <b title="pinch - squeeze sb's skin between your thumb and finger">pinches</b> his nipple and she <b title='manage to - succeed in doing sth difficult'>manages to</b> take it)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(in pain) Oh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) AAAAAAHHHHH!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(keeping on running and yelling) AAAAHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, I can't <b title='accept'>take</b> it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wait! No, no! Hey! Hey! (they all go towards the balcony but they get <b title='↗traffic jam'>jammed</b> in the window)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If we are not doing this together, we're not doing it at all! Say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and <b title='make as if - seem as if you are going to do sth but then not do it'>makes as if</b> to drop the tickets on the street).<br>
<i>Everyone</i>NO!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't come any closer!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting <b title='squish - crush sth which is soft. ↗squash'>squished</b>...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, what's more important, your friends or money?<br>
<i>Everyone but Monica</i>Friends!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Money! (they all look at her) Friends.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?<br>
<i>Monica</i>They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was <b title='used to tell sb that sth is impossible'>no way</b> I was gonna dump this...(a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon">Wiki</a>] ↗dove, olive branch'>pigeon</b> <b title='if a bird or aircraft swoops, it moves suddenly down through the air ↗dive'>swoops</b> down, scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no!

(All are returning from the street after picking up dropped lottery tickets)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, we lost half of them.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to add emphasis to what you are saying ↗in fact, actually'>As a matter of fact</b> she said that's how I am going to die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little <b title='easily made frightened or excited'>skittish</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, play them!<br>

<i>All</i>Yeah. Sorry about that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, it is so unfair. It's-it's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, she was just much better at job than me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Guys, the <b title='draw - choose by chance a card, ticket etc that will win a prize'>drawing</b> is about to start.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Ross) Oh, you know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah, it's a good idea!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how <b title='to a great or serious degree'>badly</b> you wanted that job.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on the phone) Yeah, goodnight sweetheart. I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally ruined that for me (he passes the <b title='↗microphone, transmitter'>receiver</b> to Rachel)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi mum, oh put her back on!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.<br>
<i>TV</i>Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I got that!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, oh, we have one too!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We <b title='be on a roll - be having a lot of success with what you are trying to do'>are on a roll</b>, people!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(calling Rachel) Come on!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on the phone) Mum, please! I know you love your <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery">plastic surgery</a>]'>new lips</b>, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?<br>
<i>TV</i>And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7-<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, check your numbers! Make me rich!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(she goes towards the others and she's very excited) You guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!<br>
<i>All</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Joey</i>And what did she say?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She said "gleba"! (she celebrates)<br>
(They just look at her for a moment; then they go back to checking the tickets)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Make me rich!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Ross) Isn't that amazing?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah, no no no...that's-that's great!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why-why aren't you more excited?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, of course it is!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, uh, what does it mean?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I don't know all the words.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-, yes you did, gleba is a word!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, use it in a sentence.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, uh... "Emma just said gleba"!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's not a word!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. Ok, ok, ok, fine, I'm gonna look it up. (she goes and picks up the dictionary)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're <b title='↗bring up'>at it</b> she said another word <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b>, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt...<br>
(Rachel <b title="glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">glares</b> at him)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(searching the dictionary) Alright, ok, ok, gleba, gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, <b title='a cell like a seed that is produced by some plants such as mushrooms and can develop into a new plant'>spore</b>-bearing inner mass of a certain <b title='plural of fungus [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus">Wiki</a>]'>fungi</b>.<br>
(Rachel shows Ross the definition on the dictionary, giving him a <b title='showing too much satisfaction with your own cleverness or success ↗snobbish, strut, patronize, contempt'>smug</b> look; then she <b title='squint - look at sthy with your eyes partly closed in order to see better'>squints</b> at the dictionary, as though unsure what to <b title='be just able to see/hear sth'>make out</b> of it)<br>
<i>Ross</i>She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(checking the last ticket) Damn it! Anybody got anything?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm still looking through mine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!<br>
(phone rings)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(answering phone) Hello? <b title='wait'>Hold on</b>. It's your boss.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ah, the "I'm sorry I <b title='↗accept'>rejected</b> you" phone call. <b title="but I'm used to getting it from women.">I'm not used to getting it from guys</b>. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) Hey, Steve.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your <b title='↗immature'>maturity</b> and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that <b title='things'>stuff</b>! And I'm not too mature... <b title='fart - an act of making air come out of the bowels ↗break wind'>farts</b>, <b title='breasts'>boobies</b>, <b title='↗arse, ass, buttock, bottom, posterior, rear, stern, tush, tushy, tushie'>butt</b> <b title='crack - gap'>cracks</b>!<br>
<i>Steve</i>Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of <b title='↗senior'>junior</b> <b title='sb whose job is to write the words for advertisements'>copywriter</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?<br>
<i>Steve</i>Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of <b title='the quality of being intelligent and knowing a lot/comfortable in social situations and knowing about culture, fashion etc'>sophistication</b> you'll be bringing to the job.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).<br>
(He <b title='↗casually, breezy'>idly</b> goes to the sofa, starts browsing a magazine. Everybody stares at him)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.<br>
<i>Everybody</i>(excited) Oh my God, congratulations!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used to emphasize that you agree with sb or are keen to do what they suggest'>You bet</b>! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks, man.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, before, with the wishbone... I, uh, I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, <b title='↗concerned'>worried</b>) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll <b title='tear quickly and violently'>rip</b> your heart right out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, you know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, me too. So much for my dinosaur <b title='/'>slash</b> Amelia Earhart <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg/225px-Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_park">Wiki</a>]'>theme park</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You guys, what was the Powerball number again?<br>
<i>Monica and Ross</i>Seven.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We won.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We won!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Let me see!<br>
(They all jump up excitedly and try to see the ticket)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't tear it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know that, but look, we got the Powerball number, we won 3 dollars!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow, you think we should get that over 20 years or <b title='choose'>go for</b> the big <b title='a large payment of money to sb'>payout</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(still very excited) I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh. So, Pheebs, what're you going to do with your $3?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it's not all mine. We all get 50 <b title='↗nickel, dime, quarter'>cents</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what? You can have mine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Me too.<br>
(they all look at Ross)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I guess if everybody else is...
<s>Central Perk. They're all sitting there as usual, except Joey. Gunther is serving a nearby table.</s>
(Joey comes in from the back of the coffee house)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sitting in a chair) Hey, guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to say that you disagree with sb ↗excusme, I respectfully disagree'>I beg to differ</b> (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Maybe nobody won the <b title='the most valuable prize in a game or lottery'>jackpot</b>, but there was <b title='used to mention sb/sth without giving a name ↗some'>this</b> guy in here earlier, and he found a ticket on the street, <b title='exactly'>right</b> outside, and won $10,000 (goes to the counter).<br>
(They all glare evilly at Phoebe)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the "pigeon voice" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It's not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop staring at her.<br>
(Joey stares around <b title='↗stupid'>dumbly</b> looking for the "talking pigeon")<br>

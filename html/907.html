<s>Ross and Rachel's apartment. Ross is playing with Emma on the couch after just changing her diaper.</s>
<i>Ross</i>And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. (baby talk.) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up.) Come here <b title='very beautiful'>gorgeous</b>. (puts her on his knees and talks to her.) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little <b title='If you describe sb/sth as a little bitty person or thing, you are emphasizing that they are very small ↗bit, -y'>bitty</b> baby, you know that? But you've got...

Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>, have you? You never done that before. Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and <b title='"Baby Got Back" is a song written and recorded by American artist Sir Mix-a-Lot, The first verse begins, "I like big butts and I cannot lie", and most of the song is about the rapper&#039;s attraction to large buttocks.

<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey. Hey listen, what'd you guys know about investments?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='why'>How come</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What'd you do with your money now?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, it's <b title='tape - fasten sth with sticky tape'>taped</b> to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that anyone could have <b title='overhear - accidentally hear what other people are saying ↗listen in, eavesdrop'>overheard</b> that.) I didn't say that! It's uh, it's in a bank guarded by robots!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do you have any ideas?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, yeah, <b title='↗co-worker, colleague'>this guy at work</b> got me excited about going in on an <b title='the largest bird native to Australia [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu">Wiki</a>]'>emu</b> farm. That'd be <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> cool huh? <b title='pitch in - join others and help with an activity ↗chip in'>Pitching in</b> on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joe, Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Laughs.) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica.) People eat birds. Bird meat. <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b> do they just fly into your mouth or, or you go to, you go to a restaurant and say: "'Scuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird. " (laughs again.) Or, or maybe just a wing or (realises)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, <b title='property in the form of land or houses'>real estate</b> is your best investment. <b title='The Federal Reserve System is he central banking system of the United States. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed">Wiki</a>]'>The Fed</b> just lowered the rates and the interest on your <b title='a legal agreement in which you borrow money from a bank in order to buy a house'>mortgage</b> is totally <b title='taken away from the total amount of money on which you pay tax'>deductible</b>.

<i>Joey</i>Real estate, huh? Hmm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Very excited.) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, impersonate, mime, mock, mimic, simulate'>imitating</b> Monica.) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>My dad told me. They play golf together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, well, maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the <b title='a long thin metal stick used in golf to hit the ball'>club</b> doesn't <b title='get free'>slip</b> out of my hand and beat the <b title='facial hair grown on the upper lip <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Mustache_Growing_over_30_days.gif/220px-Mustache_Growing_over_30_days.gif"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moustache">Wiki</a>] ↗sideburns, beard, goatee'>moustache</b> off his face.

<i>Monica</i>Oh, that's great!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know! What did we use to talk about?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No idea.<br>
[Phoebe enters, knocking on the door.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Listen! You have to help me pick a dress <b title='because'>'cause</b> I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? That hadn't occurred to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sweetie, they're gonna love you, just <b title='be in a normal state of body and mind, not influenced by other people'>be yourself</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They live on the <b title='a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side">Wiki</a>]'>upper east side</b> on <b title='For most of its length in Manhattan, it runs parallel to Madison Avenue to the west and Lexington Avenue to the east.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, she can't be herself.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so... all right... Which dress? (she holds up two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... <b title='take your time - do sth slowly or carefully without hurrying'>taking their time</b>, don't wanting to hurt Phoebe.) You can say "neither".<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>Oh God, neither!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You can say it nicely.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry honey, we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you wanna <b title='behave toward sb in a way that shows your sexual or romantic interest in them ↗hit on'>flirt</b> a little bit, but not in a <b title='↗nasty, disgusting'>gross</b> way. Just kind of like: "Oh Mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks."<br>
<i>Monica</i>You <b title='go out - have a romantic relationship with sb ↗ask out, date'>went out</b> with Wallis Pincer?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, he took the <b title='a standardized test for most college admissions in the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">Wiki</a>]'>SATs</b> for me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I knew you didn't get a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT#Raw_scores.2C_scaled_scores.2C_and_percentiles">Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles</a>]'>1400</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Cha yeah, well, <b title='used to say that what sb else has just said or asked is stupid'>duh</b>! I mean-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>now</b>, what-what about with Mike's mom?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, with the mother, just, just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. <b title='take it from sb - believe sb'>Take it from me</b>, moms love me. Ross's mom <b title='once'>one time</b> actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Looks at Rachel in disbelief.) She said WHAT?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Speaking louder and <b title='articulate - pronounce what you are saying in a clear and careful way ↗enunciate'>articulating</b>.) That's she's like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears.) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a "duh!" way.)
<s>Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel enters the apartment.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just finished getting Phoebe <b title='completely'>all</b> dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so <b title='making sb pleased'>sweet</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to introduce a piece of information which is surprising, or which you want to emphasize'>Guess what</b>? I made Emma laugh today.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(In disbelief.) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a <b title='a set of changes that make sb/sth look much better'>makeover</b> to that stupid <b title='sb in the 1960s who was opposed to war and the traditional attitudes of society, and who showed this by having long hair and wearing very informal clothes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">Wiki</a>]'>hippie</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, it was uhm, it was like a, a real little person laugh too. It was, it was like uhm, (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, but it comes out very <b title='making very high noises ↗-y, squeal, shriek, screech'>squeaky</b>, very high-pitched. He laughs about himself but then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) Only, only not <b title='unpleasant in a way that makes you feel nervous or frightened'>creepy</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Well, well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I uhm, Well, I sang (Rachel gasps.) actually, I rapped, uhm, Baby Got Back (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You WHAT? You sang, to our baby daughter, a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?<br>
<i>Ross</i>But you know what, if-if you think about it, it-it actually <b title='↗support, encourge'>promotes</b> a healthy uhm, body image... because... even big butts, or, uhm, <b title='very attractive in a sexual way'>juicy</b> doubles, are-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Disgusted) owww...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Please don't take her away from me.

<i>Catherine</i>Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So <b title='why'>how come</b> Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical <b title='when a professional person makes a mistake or does not do their job properly and can be punished by a court'>malpractice</b>? <b title='choke - be unable to breathe properly'>Choked</b> on his own moustache?<br>
<i>Catherine</i>Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa....<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Interupting.) Mmm That's enough about you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Is there anything we should know about the apartment?<br>
<i>Catherine</i>All the <b title='appliance - a machine or piece of equipment that you have in your home, for example a washing machine or fridge'>appliances</b> are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here (Joey and Chandler both realize what she's assuming and start laughing.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no, we're-we're not together. We're, we're not a couple. We're definitely not a couple.<br>
<i>Catherine</i>Oh... Ok, sorry!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, you-you seem <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We're not gonna have this conversation again. Look at this place. Why am I so <b title='intimidate - make sb feel worried and not confident ↗intimate'>intimidated</b> by this guy? <b title='trying to seem more important, intelligent, or high class etc'>Pretentious</b> art, this huge <b title='characterized by or exhibiting machismo (traditional male behavior)'>macho</b> couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs.) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey looks around.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what it is? It's a nice place but I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> say, I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants.) Yeah, I could see it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection.) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? <b title='a 1973 American police thriller film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Force">Wiki</a>]'>Magnum Force</b>, <b title='a 1971 American crime thriller [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry">Wiki</a>]'>Dirty Harry</b>, <b title='a 1967 American prison drama film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Hand_Luke">Wiki</a>]'>Cool Hand Luke</b>... Oh my God!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh! A tape with a girl's name on it. It's probably a sex tape (realises.) Wait a minute, this says Monica (looks around.) And this is Richard's apartment (realises some more.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands)

<i>Phoebe</i>(No accent.) Uhm... Ok, well, all right, uhm, originally I'm from <b title='an area of New York north of the New York City metropolitan area [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate">Wiki</a>]'>upstate</b>, but uhm... then my mom <b title='↗suicide, homicide, pesticide'>killed herself</b> and my stepdad went to prison, so...

<i>Chandler</i>I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching it? (sighs.) Well, we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the <b title='Video Cassette Recorder [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vcr">Wiki</a>]'>VCR</b> and Joey enters the apartment.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>How did she get me to <b title='begin to live a quieter life by getting married or staying permanently in a place'>settle down</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, I'm gonna watch it. I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is. And even if it is, it can't possibly be as bad as what I'm <b title='picture - imagine'>picturing</b> in my head (laughs nervously.) Can it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped, she doesn't say no to much else, I'll tell <b title='you'>ya</b><br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='move backwards'>Backs off</b>.) What? Whoo-what?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is. Please?<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, fine. But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame. (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape.

<i>Monica</i>What're you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the TV and looks at it.) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only <b title='for a split second - an instant; an tiny period of time'>takes a split second</b> for Joey to realize, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and she falls, face down next to Chandler.

Please laugh for mommy (Rachel makes a funny face, <b title='stick - put'>sticking</b> her tongue out, making a <b title='↗pee, poo, break wind'>farting</b> noise and using her hands as <b title='one of the horns on the head of a male deer ↗antenna'>antlers</b>, <b title='wiggle - make short quick movements from side to side'>wiggling</b> her fingers. No response from Emma) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only <b title='very rude or insulting and likely to upset people'>offensive</b> <b title='new and unusual ↗novel'>novelty</b> rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap (Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are. Oh, I can't rap... All right, sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody (Rachel's face like, "Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through..." and she starts to rap.) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh.) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really <b title='get into - start enjoying sth or become enthusiastic about it'>gets into</b> it, and her <b title='not confident'>insecure</b> movements start getting better.) I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> like big butts, don't you. Oh, you beautiful little <b title='sb who behaves in a way that seems strange'>weirdo</b>... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried...Different... I just sang a little doo... <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itsy_Bitsy_Spider">Wiki</a>]'>Itsy Bitsy Spider</b><br>
<i>Ross</i>You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing else worked. That girl <b title='be about sb/sth - have sb/sth as the subject matter or main point of interest'>is all about</b> the ass.
<s>Mike's parents house, the dining room. Mike, Phoebe, Mike's parents and the Angles are there.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>...and then it goes back to the <b title='the part of a song that does not change and is repeated several times ↗chant'>chorus</b>. Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / It's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise you hadn't, ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha-what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='pervert - sb whose sexual behaviour is considered unnatural and unacceptable. parade - a public celebration in which a large group of people move through an area ↗gay cruise'>Pervert Parade</b>?<br>
<i>Mike</i>(Sighs.) No...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='a poem or song written in order to praise sb/sth'>Ode</b> To A <b title='connected with the area around the sexual organs ↗public, private, curly'>Pubic Hair</b>?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Stop! (The butler serves dinner.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh God! Is that <b title='meat from a young cow ↗beef'>veal</b>?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Mom, I thought I told you, Phoebe's a <b title='sb who does not eat meat or fish'>vegetarian</b>.<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, no, no, no, that's ok, that's ok, I mean, I'm, I am a vegetarian, except for veal. Yeah no, veal I love.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Phoebe you don't have to eat-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, no, no, actually, no, it's any baby animals: <b title='↗kitty, tomcat'>kittens</b>, fish babies, you know, especially veal, you know, and this, this nice <b title='line/layer'>vein</b> of fat running through it (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to <b title='control a feeling or problem'>overcome</b> her vegetarian thoughts and puts it in her mouth. Clearly not enjoying the meat) Hmmm, <b title='↗delicious'>yummy</b> (everybody seems ok with it, except Mike. He's making a face. Then Phoebe swallows it.) Hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You hear a door slamming.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>So? What do you think? (looks at his parents, who look disgusted.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's. Monica switches off the VCR. Joey and Chandler are behind the couch.</s>
<i>Monica</i>So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Whoho ho... Listen to the judgment from the <b title='pornography - pictures, videos etc that is intended to make people feel sexually excited'>porn</b> star!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That tape was never <b title='intended to'>meant to</b> be seen by (pauses.) Joey, I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Laughs.) Monica, look, I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore (Monica keeps looking at Joey.) Not ready to joke about it yet, ok, I'll see you later. (Walks out.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why <b title='used for emphasis'>in the world</b> would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because that's who I am, ok? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another <b title='saucy jokes, remarks etc are about sex in a way that is amusing but not shocking'>saucy</b> <b title='a story that you tell people about sth interesting or funny that has happened to you'>anecdote</b> for him to share at his men's club over <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy">Wiki</a>]'>brandy</b>, moustaches.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not <b title='"get over sb" means the memories no longer affect you very much emotionally'>over</b> you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Isn't that <b title='↗pathetic'>sad</b>? I mean, can-can you <b title='understand'>see</b> how <b title='making you feel pity or sympathy'>pathetic</b> that is? You-you shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Yo- I can grow a moustache!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, this is not our problem. We got each other. That's all that matters.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she turns on the video again.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.<br>
<i>Monica</i>THAT'S NOT ME!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride him cowgirl!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression changes.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is that a problem?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I-It's just so insulting! Quick <b title='a sudden quick movement or jump in a particular direction'>spring</b> for a new blank tape, Doctor!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, but the important thing is that we have each other, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well yeah. It's-it's so rude! I mean, let me tell you, the way we <b title='do it - have sex'>did it</b> was a lot better-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you going to finish that sentence?
<s>Mike's parents house. Dining room again. Both Mike and Phoebe are not at the table, but the others still are.</s>
<i>Theodore</i><b title='not know what sb sees in sb - used to say that you do not know why sb likes sb else'>I can't imagine what he sees in her</b>.<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>She actually makes me miss that <b title='pop pills - take pills regularly, esp ones containing an illegal drug'>pill-popping</b> ex-wife of his. (Mike walks in.) Oh, hello dear.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey, what's going on?<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>We were just <b title='chit-chat - informal conversation about unimportant matters ↗small talk'>chit-chatting</b>. How's your friend?<br>
<i>Mike</i>A little better.<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.<br>
<i>Theodore</i>You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well-behaved and... single.<br>
<i>Mike</i>I'm not interested.<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real.<br>
<i>Mike</i>All right, stop. You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. Maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah, she's a little different than you are-<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (Phoebe almost enters the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and <b title="eavesdrop - listen to sb's private conversation without them knowing ↗overhear, listen in">eavesdrops</b> next to the door-opening.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>So what? I mean if even I can <b title='↗get over'>get past</b> that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you can't even be <b title='polite ↗courtesy, politeness'>civil</b> to the woman I love...<br>
<i>Bitsy</i>The woman you what? (Phoebe heard what Michael said and now enters the room.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, the woman you what?<br>
<i>Mike</i>The woman I love (Walks to Phoebe.) I love you... which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...who are by the way the most <b title='sinful - very bad/wicked'>sinfully</b> boring people I've ever met in my life.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I love you too.<br>
<i>Mike</i>You do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>YEAH! How great is this? (they kiss.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Wanna get out of here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I had a great time. (accent.) It was really <b title='of the highest importance, rank, privilege, or merit ↗top-notch, first-rate'>top drawer</b>.

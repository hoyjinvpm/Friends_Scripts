<i>Chandler</i>Well believe it baby!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well I-I'm-I'm not moving.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's so pretty! And look, and it's purple! And <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, you with your steady hand, I am not moving, and now <b title='↗put your foot down - say very firmly that sb must do sth or must stop doing sth'>I have got the steady hand</b>.

<i>Alice</i>Oh! Hi, Phoebe! Um, we were just at the drugstore and so we got you uh a little present.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. Oh. Wow. (Get's a <b title="when sb's blood pressure suddenly falls when standing up or stretching [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension'>Wiki</a>]">headrush</b>) That's where all my blood was.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well it's a stupid, unfair question!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Don't blame the questions!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Will you stop calling it your apartment!<br>
<i>Joey</i>But it is our apartment!<br>

<i>Frank</i>MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!<br>
(They all go over and hug Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. Ok, but this can't be good for the baby.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
<s>Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are busy unpacking.</s>
<i>Monica</i>I can't find garbage bags!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I think I saw some in here.<br>
(She opens a door and they both scream at horror at what's inside of it.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is it?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe we're living here!

<i>Chandler</i>What?! What-what is it?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Did you see the size of the closets?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't believe we live here!<br>
(They both sit down on the chairs and put up the foot rest.)<br>

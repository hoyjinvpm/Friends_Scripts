<s>Joey's place. Rachel and Joey are talking.</s>
<i>Joey</i>All right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win, you do not move to Paris.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're <b title='(of a new competition or argument) beginning.'>on</b>! All right Joe, you remember the rules! <b title='the side of a coin that has a picture of the head of a person on it'>Heads</b> I win, tails you lose.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Just <b title='toss (a coin)'>flip</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(she flips the coin) Ha, tails!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Damn it!<br>
(Chandler and Monica enter the room)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So we thought we'd <b title='organize a party'>throw</b> you a little going away party <b title='approximately at'>around</b> seven.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, that sounds good!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's all done!<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='↗sarcastic'>Oh, yeah, right</b>! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris <b title='things'>stuff</b>, these are the boxes that I'm having <b title='ship - send goods somewhere by ship, plane, truck etc'>shipped</b>, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Which <b title='used to say sb/sth needs a particular thing very much'>could use</b> a little more <b title='a yellow sauce with a strong taste [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_%28condiment%29">Wiki</a>]'>mustard</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your <b title='carry-on - a small bag or case that you carry onto a plane with you'>carry-ons</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! I've nothing left to teach you! (they <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Where's your passport?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It should be <b title='exactly, directly'>right</b> next to my plane ticket.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's not.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must've packed it in one of these boxes!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='used to avoid saying shit ↗freaking, flinging-flanging, fucking, heck,hell'>Shoot</b>. Oh, I can't believe I did this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Joey) At what <b title='a particular moment in time'>point</b> did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
<s>Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica are talking about the baby, and Monica is rubbing Erica's <b title='↗abdomen, belly'>tummy</b>.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?<br>
<i>Erica</i>I know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?<br>
<i>Erica</i>No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but <b title='at the present time'>right now</b> your hand is <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='block - stop sth from moving through or along sth'>blocking</b> the part where the baby is gonna come out.<br>
(She takes her hand off Erica. Ross enters the room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! <br>
<i>Erica</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Erica, welcome back to town! (pause) Wow, look how big you've <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b>.<br>
<i>Erica</i>That's because I'm <b title='↗knock up, conceive, infertile, sterile'>pregnant</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right, no, I-I understand.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. <br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, I knew (he <b title="↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">stares</b> at her breasts).<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Ross) Ok, well, stop staring at them.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She <b title='bring up - mention a subject or start to talk about it'>brought them up</b>! (pause) I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!<br>
<i>Erica</i>Yeah, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, and I wanted her to <b title='gradually start to know'>get to know</b> the doctors and get <b title='settle into - become familiar with a new way of life, place etc'>settled into</b> the hotel.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't <b title='be reasonable/sensible ↗logical'>make sense</b>.<br>
<i>Erica</i><b title='used to add more information ↗besides'>Plus</b> hotels are fun! My room has this little <b title='↗refrigerator, freezer'>fridge</b> full of free <b title='snack - a small amount of food that you eat between meals'>snacks</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest <b title='mark up - an increase in the price of sth'>mark-ups</b> of any consumer product-<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.<br>
<i>Erica</i>(standing up) I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> back.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation ↗boy, my'>man</b>, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The <b title="a legal contract in which you agree to pay to use sb else's building etc ↗landlord, tenant, deposit">lease</b> is still in <b title='grandmother'>nana</b>'s name.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, it takes two incomes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Mhm, (he <b title='consider the importance of one thing in relation to sth else when you are making a decision'>balance</b> things) packing, sexy cheerleader comedy.<br>

<s>Guest room. Joey has his head wrapped in bubbled wrap and Chandler is <b title='punch - hit ↗pound'>punching</b> him. Ross enters the room.</s>
<i>Ross</i>What're you guys doing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross starts punching him too)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(enters the room) Are, are you kidding? This is packing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We're taking a <b title='rest'>break</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>From?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Jumping on the bed?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. <b title='used when telling or reminding sb to do sth'>Now</b>, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these <b title='yahoo - sb who is rude and violent'>yahoos</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="You'll get what you want">You got it</b>! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> get serious. (He grabs a bag of <b title='polystyrene (polystyrene) foam [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrofoam">Wiki</a>]'>Styrofoam</b> <b title='the shape'>peanuts</b>) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should <b title='start'>get to</b> work. I'll take <b title='things'>stuff</b> out of the closet, Joey you pack <b title='them'>'em</b> and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.<br>
(Joey takes the bubble wrap off his head)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You guys hear a ringing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Handcuffs! And fur <b title='lining - sth put on the inside of another thing'>line</b>, nice! I didn't know you guys had <b title='a quality of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdsm">BDSM</a>?'>it</b> in <b title='you'>ya</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this <b title='bum out - depress/disappoint'>bums me out</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I didn't know Monica had these!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be <b title='used to describe sexual behavior that most people would consider strange or unusual'>kinky</b>! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='bum - bum out'>Bumming</b> hard, guys, bumming hard.
<s>Monica's apartment. Phoebe and Ross enter the room.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! Where's Mike?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, he has a <b title='a playing engagement for a musical artist or band / any job'>gig</b>. It's kinda like being married to a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music">Wiki</a>]'>rock star</b>, you know. My husband has a gig.<br>

<i>Ross</i><b title='general encouraging or positive exclamation'>Rock on</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(watching the food on the table) Wow, this is quite a <b title='an impressive buffet (a meal at which all the food is put on a table and people go and choose what they want) of food'>spread</b>! (pause) What is all this stuff?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to <b title='↗run up'>use up</b> all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoked <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster">Wiki</a>]'>oyster</b> <b title='food that is cooked slowly in liquid in a covered dish in the oven'>casserole</b> with a breakfast <b title='a food made from grain'>cereal</b> <b title='a layer of pastry (a food made by mixing flour, fat, and water)'>crust</b>, <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Kidney_beans.jpg/300px-Kidney_beans.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_bean">Wiki</a>]'>kidney beans</b> in their own juices, and for dessert, a <b title='probably not good ↗doubtful, dubious, suspicious'>questionable</b> orange.<br>

<i>Joey</i>(entering the room) Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, where's Rach?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, she's uh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
(Rachel enters the room)<br>
<i>Everybody</i>Hey Rach, hey you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Here she is!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(crying) Hi you guys!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What did I just say?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, no, no. It's ok. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come here, I'll make you a drink.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when <b title='a soap opera [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melrose_Place">Wiki</a>]'>Melrose Place</b> got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks <b title='↗confused, bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>puzzled</b>) I mean... oh, <b title="do not think or worry about it (if they'll judge me)">forget it</b>. I miss Melrose Place!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Ross) You know, I had a chance to stop her too!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who loses fifty seven coin tosses <b title='happening a number of times, one after the other'>in a row</b>? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(to Rachel) Are you doing ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I've been better.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-hmm.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I'm gonna miss you so much.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Huh, if I had to guess, I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
<s>Guest room. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out from her pocket) but I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> have something for you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). Oh. What is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it's a cotton <b title='a short narrow stick with a piece of cotton on the end, often used by doctors or nurses ↗swap, Q-tip'>swab</b> with a bit of my <b title='the liquid produced by glands in your mouth ↗spit'>saliva</b> on it, so that if they <b title='make sth perfect'>perfect</b> the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna">Wiki</a>]'>DNA</b> to create your own Pheebs!<br>

<s>Monica's apartment. The living room.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yes. I decided to <b title='leave out - to not include'>leave these out</b> for you in case Richard <b title='stop by - make a short visit somewhere ↗come over, drop by'>stops by</b> and you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='engage - become involved in an activity'>engage on</b> a little light <b title='the practice of being tied up for sexual pleasure'>bondage</b> and moustache play!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you talking about? These aren't mine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? Then what're they doing in our guestroom?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel used to live in that room.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey's <b title='naked'>bare</b> ass!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.<br>
(Phoebe and Rachel enter the living room.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I love you Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I love you too. (they hug) Please, please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French <b title='an unkind or unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>! (they hug again)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Monica?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Will you come here with me for a minute?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Monica) Are you wearing <b title='↗bulletproof, fireproof, foolproof, soundproof'>waterproof</b> <b title='a dark substance used for making eyelashes look darker or longer'>mascara</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you're so <b title='in trouble or in a bad situation'>screwed</b>. (Monica goes into the guestroom)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you kidding? Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you. God, Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they <b title='express your feelings about sth through your behavior or actions, esp when you have been feeling angry or nervous'>act out</b> by giving me such bad evaluations.

<s>The guestroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Mon... Ok... I better... just say what it is I'm gonna say. None of the amazing things that've happened to me in the last ten years, wouldn't 've happened if it wasn't for you. No one's been more like a sister to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to <b title='↗incoherent, unintelligible, incomprehensible'>understand</b> what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(says something that cannot be understood)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That is so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. (they hug)
<s>Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(to Joey) Oh no, she <b title='take down - defeat'>took down</b> Monica. And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well it's ok. Chandler is talking to her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I really made you think about that thing uh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't <b title='understand'>get</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I think you're forgetting the <b title='most kinky'>kinkiest</b> former resident of that room.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(from the other side of the room) Yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think these are yours.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>These are not mine... Look how <b title='badly made and not strong enough'>flimsy</b> they are, <b title='tell sb that you know that what they have just said was not true'>come on</b>! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll <b title='break'>snap</b> like a piece of <b title='a black substance produced from the root of a plant, used in medicine and sweets [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licorice">Wiki</a>]'>licorice</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Where do you think Mike really is? (she <b title='giggle - laugh in a nervous, excited, or silly way ↗chuckle'>giggles</b>, Chandler looks <b title='shocked and upset ↗ghastly, disgusted'>aghast</b>)
<s>The guestroom. Chandler and Rachel.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh,honey...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just wanna say that I... I love you. And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(all <b title='expressing love in a silly way'>mushy</b>) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ooh, not so tight... (<b title="stick one's tongue out with the lips held tightly around it, and blowing. Creates a sound approximating farting (not so tight around my tummy). ↗pull my finger">blows raspberry</b>, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Oh.<br>
(Chandler blows raspberry again)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
<s>Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't think so.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That old woman was being <b title='scam - get money or goods from sb by tricking them'>scammed</b> by her mechanic.<br>
<i>Ross</i>God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why're they taking so long?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.<br>
(Rachel and Joey hug, and Rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. At that moment Joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.)<br>
<i>All</i>No, no, no, no!<br>
(Rachel rushes back and pulls Joey back onto the balcony, and takes him inside.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I think I'm gonna <b title='leave ↗see off'>take off</b>. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I've such a big big day tomorrow. So...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aren't you forgetting something?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, right! Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I forgot to write your mom a birthday card. Would you please do that for me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.<br>
(She leaves the apartment and they all stare at Ross)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? I don't get a goodbye?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(still very emotional) Lucky <b title='a word that some people use about or to sb, esp a man, who they feel very jealous of or sorry for'>bastard</b>!
<s>Monica's apartment continued. Phoebe, Chandler, Monica and Joey are sitting down and Ross is <b title='pace - walk with regular steps around a small area, because you are worried, nervous, or impatient'>pacing</b> up and down.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, <b title='suggested without being directly expressed ≠explicit ↗imply'>implicit</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, it needs to be <b title='im- - not/not'>plicit</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know maybe, she was just really <b title='exhausted ↗worn out'>spent</b> from our talk. It was <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> <b title='involving or done with a lot of effort, energy, attention etc'>intense</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, mine too.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Mine was a <b title='sth that is very exciting or impressive'>humdinger</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(annoyed) O-kay!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, all right all right, let's think about this. I mean, there's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I don't, I don't think so.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You didn't, <b title='used to give an example'>say</b>, borrow her Girls Gone Wild video and never return it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? Now?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I mean don't I deserve anything? I mean a few tears, a <b title='brief ↗cursor, caret'>cursory</b> hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) Not from you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>THE HELL I DO!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(talking <b title='worried or upset ↗irritated'>agitated</b> and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What I gotta do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, <b title='have a romantic relationship with sb ↗ask out, date'>go out</b> with you? Have, have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh no, maybe me, I'm just not giving you, enough <b title='approval or praise'>credit</b>. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes <b title='choke - be unable to breathe properly because sth is in your throat or there is not enough air'>choking</b> noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you wanna leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of <b title='If you are desperate, you are in such a bad situation that you are willing to try anything to change it ↗frustrated'>desperate</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rach, I know this may not be the best time, but uh, Joey's going over the balcony again. Could you just come talk to him?
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment. The others are still there.</s>
<i>Monica</i>I hope Ross isn't too upset.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to say you already know about sth'>Tell me about it</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, I think I'm gonna <b title='go in particular direction'>head</b> out.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, where do you think you're going?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We're moving in a couple of days and we got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could <b title='join in and help with an activity ↗chip in'>pitch in</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Joey and I can finish up in the guestroom.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Joey) You couldn't be <b title='↗nonchalant - behaving calmly and not seeming interested in anything or worried about anything, casual, breezy'>cool</b>. (he goes to the guestroom)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and <b title='arrange things so that they stand one on top of another ↗pile, heap'>stack</b> ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> bubble wrapped. <b title='understand'>Got it</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe and Joey</i>Yeah. Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am <b title='cruel, severe and unkind'>harsh</b> with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Mon, I think I <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figured out</b> whose handcuffs they are.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You did? How?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who's that <b title='sexually adventurous (eager to try new or exciting things)'>dirty</b> old lady?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica's grandmother.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nana liked it <b title='not gentle'>rough</b>!<br>
(Erica, the pregnant girl, enters)<br>
<i>Erica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Erica</i>Hey, what're you guys looking at?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, just normal pictures of our regular <b title='a group of people who are related to each other'>family</b>, not having sex.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on here, have a seat.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How was your night?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Oh, it was ok. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to <b title='used to mention sb/sth without giving a name ↗some'>this</b>this</b> place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... <b title='used when you are changing the subject of a conversation or returning to a previous subject'>Anyway</b>, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Erica, are-are you ok?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Relax! We'll just get her some <b title='a medicine that reduces the amount of acid in your stomach ↗anti-'>antacids</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in <b title="the process by which a baby is pushed from its mother's body during birth">labor</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you gotta <b title='arrive at, reach'>get to</b> the hospital!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, Chandler, get the coats. Erica, let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I gotta sit down, I gotta sit down. Ooh! (she's <b title='hyperventilate - breathe too quickly because you are very frightened or excited ↗hyper-, ventilation, gasp, inhale, exhale'>hyperventilating</b>)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, it's gonna be ok.<br>
<i>Erica</i>You can do this. Just breathe.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, ok. Ok, I feel, I feel a little better.<br>
<i>Erica</i>(in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Ok bye everyone.<br>
(There's a lot of supportive cheers from all. Erica, Monica and Chandler leave.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler, wait, wait, wait.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
<s>Ross's apartment.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(writing a birthday card) Dear Judy, happy birthday, love, Rach.. (to himself) No, you know what, I'm not doing this (throws the pen)<br>
(Rachel <b title='burst in - enter a room or building suddenly and noisily =storm in'>bursts in</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's what it seemed like.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I cannot believe, that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine, then why didn't you say something?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Ok, so if you think that, that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye. Oh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You can-can't, you can't-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>WHAT?<br>
(Ross walks over to her and starts to kiss her passionately. After a while Rachel <b title='back out - withdraw, retreat'>backs out</b>. She thinks a while and starts kissing him back.)
<s>Chandler and Monica's apartment.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, a little more.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (she starts to <b title='push or put sth into a small space'>stuff</b> styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>A little more, a little more.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's <b title='assess - carefully consider/calculate'>assesses</b> the how many there already are in there.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>A little more... All right. Ok, all right, let's do this.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, ready?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Now, <b title='make as much effort as you can'>give me your best shot</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, <b title='begin an act'>here goes</b>...<br>
(she <b title='knee - hit sb with your knee'>knees</b> him in the <b title='the area between your legs where they join your body ↗groin, loins'>crotch</b>. He jumps up a bit)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh!<br>

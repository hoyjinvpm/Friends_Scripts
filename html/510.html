<i>Monica</i>Oh, God, stop with the plan! All right, so what, so <b title='used for asking what would happen in a particular situation'>what if</b> you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're gonna go out on a date with Danny and you're gonna be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm just gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Joey's not going.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, why can't you finish them tomorrow?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.<br>

<i>Ross</i>I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, you think Fireball's relaxing, you obviously 've never played.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Ok, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, look, guys, don't <b title='argue'>fight</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And the reason I'm doing this, is because I, am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total <b title='sb who does stupid, annoying, or unkind things'>jerk</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.<br>

<i>Danny</i>Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.<br>

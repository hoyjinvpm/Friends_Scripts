<i>Chandler</i>(excited) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh...Monica's pregnant?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed) Let's <b title='↗get over'>get past</b> the moment.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's your news?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thank you. I got a job in <b title='↗commercial'>advertising</b>. (Everybody cheers)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle, snuggle'>hugging</b> Chandler) Oh, honey, that's <b title='extremely good; great =unbelievable'>incredible</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='wanting to discover as much as you can about things ↗curious'>inquisitive</b>) <b title='used to express surprise'>Gosh</b>, what's the pay like?

(She looks at Joey) Hey Joey! (Joey <b title='wink - quickly close and open one eye as a sign to sb'>winks</b> at her)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, actually, it pays nothing. It's an <b title='a job that lasts for a short time, that sb, esp a student, does in order to gain experience ↗part-time, moonlight'>internship</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Right. So, it'll be the same except...less sex with you. (Joey nods)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, uh, what <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='things'>stuff</b> do you think they'll have you do there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(enthusiastic) That's great.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I mean, there's probably <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be some <b title='work that you do in order to prepare for sth'>groundwork</b> which will probably <b title='be bad ↗suck'>stink</b>, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little <b title='↗embarrassing'>humiliating</b>.<br>
(At the same time, Gunther puts down a cup of coffee in front of Chandler)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='grin - smile showing your teeth ↗smirk'>grinning</b> awkwardly) Humiliating and noble! Thank you.<br>
(Gunther <b title='shoot sb a look/glance - look at sb quickly ↗glimpse'>shoots</b> a <b title='disgusting'>nasty</b> look at him while leaving)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, if-if I didn't already have a job, I-I think, I would have been really good in advertising.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, you did not <b title='think of'>come up with</b> "<b title="an American advertising campaign encouraging the consumption of cow's milk [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_Milk'>Wiki</a>]">got milk?</b>"<br>

<i>Monica</i>He just left.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='↗confused, bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>puzzled</b>) Who did? (Monica looks <b title='confused'>bewildered</b>)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(enthusiastic) You got it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(still surprised) I did?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is she talking about?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know, but it sounds great.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Your agent called. You got that <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>With-with <b title='played by Jeff Goldblum [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum">Wiki</a>]'>Leonard Hayes</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God, that is great! That is gonna for a play on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre">Wiki</a>]'>Broadway</b>...and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the <b title='delicatessen - a small shop that sells high quality foods'>deli</b> like last time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is it a good play?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, it must be, because I read it and I didn't understand a singe word.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And Leonard Hayes is <b title='start - be the main actor or performer in a movie, play etc'>starring</b> in it...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah, and directing.<br>

<i>Rachel and Joey</i>(pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces) Ah!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, he has, he's done some amazing work.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those <b title='=mobile (phone)'>cellphone</b> commercials.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(almost laughing) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone? (They all laugh)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sitting down) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!

<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Good morning, everybody.<br>
<i>Intern</i>Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys...except for the tie, the briefcase...and the fact that I can rent a car.<br>
<i>Intern</i>Seriously, you're an intern?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, well, I'm kinda <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heading</b> into a new career direction and, you know, you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> start at the bottom.<br>

<s>Audition room, Joey is lead into the room by a receptionist in a <b title='fashionable and expensive'>fancy</b> dress.</s>
<i>Receptionist</i>This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Leonard Hayes.<br>
(Leonard Hayes turns around in his chair to face Joey)<br>
<i>Joey</i>It is so amazing to meet you. (They are shaking hands) I'm such a big fan of your work.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I've...I've <b title='be blessed with - have a special ability, good quality etc'>been blessed with</b> a...a lot of great roles.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say that you already know sth'>Tell me about it</b>! "<b title='apparently it is a cellphone commercial'>Unlimited nights and weekends!</b>"<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You <b title='↗laught at, mock'>making fun of</b> me? Because I am not a <b title='sb who has not done what they promised to do or who is not loyal to their friends or supporters'>sell-out</b>. (He stands up and walks <b title='menacing - threatening'>menacingly</b> towards Joey) I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin, because of bad wireless service.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, <b title='↗sincerely, truly'>honestly</b>, I-I think you were great in those commercials.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> bring a certain <b title='qualities that sb has that make people believe or trust them'>credibility</b> to the role.<br>

<i>Leonard</i>What the hell are you still doing here?<br>
(Joey stares at him, fascinated by his performance)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Err, I think you know.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Bastard!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I am what you made me. You know what? I could go <b title='at the present time/immediately'>right now</b>.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Go, go!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>So, sorry. You-you're not supposed to say "long pause".<br>
<i>Joey</i>(understandingly) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an <b title='↗Dance with Wolves [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves">Wiki</a>]'>Indian</b> or something, you know with a...(He mimes wearing a feather on his head)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it you know, with an accent, you know, Southern (He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent) "I could go right now, maaan!"<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(<b title='very shocked or upset ↗dumbfounded, dumbstruck'>stunned</b>, <b title='mutter - speak in a low voice ↗mumble, muffle'>muttering</b>) My God in heaven.<br>
(The producers stand up)<br>
<i>Producer #1</i>Joey, <b title='wait'>hang on</b> for <b title='a very short period of time'>a second</b>. Leonard, can we talk to you for a moment?<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Yes.<br>
(They stand aside, talking)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. (Joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression).<br>
(Producer #1 whispers something)<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Hey! I-I-I don't care he thinks he's <b title='sexy'>hot</b>, you know. If you wanna sleep with him, do it on your own time. (Joey smiles <b title='smug - showing too much satisfaction with your own cleverness or success'>smugly</b> at this) This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.<br>
(Joey approaches them)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(interrupting their conversation) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I would love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And-and also: (to Producer #1) 'How you doing?' (to Leonard again) You should, please, just-just give me another chance. I really wanna get better, please.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my <b title='↗comment, explanation, tip'>notes</b>. Ready?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking <b title='by a large amount'>way</b> too much.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I really doubt that.<br>
<i>Leonard</i>(explaining to Joey, who nods <b title='fervent - believing or feeling sth very strongly and sincerely'>fervently</b>.) No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no <b title='the feeling of wanting sthh very much or wanting it immediately'>urgency</b>. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's-it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.<br>
(Joey <b title='ponder - consider'>ponders</b> on this for a while)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(suggesting.) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?<br>
<i>Leonard</i> I'm gonna <b title='damage or destroy sth violently with an explosion or by shooting'>blow</b>, blow (Leaves)
<s><b title='a small street ↗alley'>Backstreet</b>, Ross and Phoebe walking.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I can't. I've-I've got a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> with that waitress, that Katy. Yeah, I-I know we've only gone out like twice, but, I don't know, I have a really good feeling about her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I hear <b title='<a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/2323308">Why do they ring the bells for weddings?</a>'>divorce bells</b>.<br>
(A <b title='sb who attacks people in a public place and robs them'>mugger</b>, his face hidden by a cap, approaches them from behind)<br>
<i>Mugger</i><b title='=all right'>Alright</b>. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='be taken aback - be very shocked or surprised'>taken aback</b>) What?<br>
<i>Mugger</i>I have a gun (It looks like he has a gun under his coat)<br>
<i>Ross</i>O-ok. Just just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. (He searches his coat and <b title='freak out - become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaks out</b>). Oh my God, I can't find my wallet.<br>
(He finally finds the wallet and hands it to the mugger)<br>
<i>Mugger</i>Alright, lady, now give me your <b title='handbag'>purse</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(still in a high-pitched voice) What'd you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.<br>
(<b title='↗ring a bell, recall, recollect, remember'>A sign of recognition</b> runs across Phoebe's face)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Lowell, is that you?<br>
<i>Lowell</i>Phoebe? (He lifts his cap) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='simultaneous - happening or done at the same time'>simultaneously</b>) Oh my God!<br>
(They hug and scream)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(excited) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.<br>
<i>Lowell</i>Ross, nice to meet you. (He stretches his hand out to him)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, a real pleasure.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ah, it's been so long, oh, so long. (They hug again) I can't believe you're still doing this!<br>
<i>Lowell</i>Oh, I know, but I quit smoking!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='to express approval'>Good for you</b>!<br>
<i>Lowell</i>So you look like you're doing really well! I guess your mugging days are behind you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh.(she nods)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(shocked) Oh my God. Phoebe, you used to mug people?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Excuse me, Ross, old friends <b title='catch up - talk to sb you have not seen for some time and find out what they have been doing'>catching up</b>...

<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, how'd the audition <b title='happen'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Leonard Hayes did not like me. (He sits down)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, he said I wasn't urgent, enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used to say that an activity has gone well until now'>So far so good</b>! (Joey nods)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(standing up, walking towards him) I didn't know you were coming home for lunch. Can I get you anything?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure. A tube of <b title='a cleaner used to assist in denture cleaning [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polident">Wiki</a>]'>Polident</b>? Some <b title='Depend is a brand of absorbent, disposable underwear for adults experiencing urinary or fecal incontinence. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depends">Wiki</a>]'>Depends</b>? Birthday wishes from <b title='born March 7, 1934 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Scott">Wiki</a>]'>Willard Scott</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am so much older than these interns. I can't compete with them.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have so much life experience.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, but I don't think life experience is gonna help me, with these. (He opens the box and takes an <b title='↗Rollerblade [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_blade">Wiki</a>]'>inline skate</b>-like <b title='a shoe made of cloth and rubber, mainly used for playing sports'>sneaker</b> out)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wooooooooow (He takes the sneaker) It's like they're on fire!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What are they? (They sit down again.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They're these prototype sneakers that I have to come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever wear these.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(determined) I'll give you $500 for <b title='them'>'em</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What am I supposed to do with these?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers <b title='↗constantly, continuously, (every) now and then, (every) once in a while, from time to time, at times'>all the time</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. <b title='↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b>, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look, they got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because, apparently, walking, is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood <b title='when sb is very fat in a way that is unhealthy ↗diabetes'>obesity</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, kids today have such an easier time getting fat.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Would you help me try to sell these?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, have you considered using a girl with huge <b title='breasts ↗boobs'>knockers</b>?<br>

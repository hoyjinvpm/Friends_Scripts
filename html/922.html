<i>Rachel</i>Ah? Oh, I'm sorry, nothing, I was just-I was just reading to Emma.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, yeah. It's uh, "<b title='if a situation, process, or story climaxes, it reaches its most important or exciting part ↗peak, summit, orgasm'>climax</b> your way to better skin."<br>
<i>Charlie</i>(to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at <b title='pick out - choose sb/sth from a group'>picking out</b> clothes!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So you need someone who knows fashion, to uh tell you what looks good.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well...<br>
<i>Charlie</i>I'm sure you have better things to do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste!

<i>Joey</i>What's the matter, Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!" So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Exactly!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look <b title='wonderful'>fabulous</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I can't believe my <b title='↗semen'>sperm</b> have low <b title='motile - able to move by itself ↗mobile'>motility</b> because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Doctor Connelly</i>Well, I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but uh I wanted to talk to you about your options.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Doctor Connelly</i>Well, first of all, even though your chances of <b title='↗pregnant, knock up'>conceiving</b> through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ah, damn it!<br>
(Dr. Connelly <b title='↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glares</b> at Chandler)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Don't worry, after a while you'll-you'll <b title='tune out - stop listening to sth'>tune it out</b>.<br>
<i>Doctor Connelly</i>Well, <b title='considering'>given</b> your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be <b title='an arrangement in which a woman carries and delivers a child for another couple or person [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy">Wiki</a>]'>surrogacy</b>, or <b title='inseminate - put sperm into a woman or female animal in order to make her have a baby ↗pregnant, semen'>insemination</b> using a sperm <b title='↗donation'>donor</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(long pause) Ok.<br>
<i>Doctor Connelly</i>And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you could always adopt.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly, but we don't think we want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!<br>

<i>Charlie</i>Umh... Kurts Baley?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, right!

<i>Joey</i>Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>So you're up for keynote speaker!<br>\
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Who's making the decision?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Professor Sherman, yeah. I'm meeting with him today.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Oh, he's a <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> <b title='difficult to deal with/emotionally strong'>tough</b> guy to impress.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, well, I think I know how to <b title='make sb feel strong admiration'>dazzle</b> him.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are <b title='you'>ya</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk <b title='a long narrow piece of fabric or other material'>streamer</b> off his sleeve).<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey you guys!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> ask you something. I-I-I may <b title='have the opportunity'>get to</b> speak at this paleontology <b title='a large formal meeting ↗conference, confer (discuss)'>convention</b> and if I do, I'd love you guys to come and hear me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think I can safely say that we all have family <b title='problems'>issues</b>, work <b title='things'>stuff</b> and/or are sick.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados">Wiki</a>]'>Barbados</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But you come first!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm there!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know Ross, I'm not feeling too...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Barbados is in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean">Wiki</a>] ↗pirate, Black Pearl, Jack Sparrow'>the Caribbean</b>, Joe.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why didn't anybody say so?!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>See you later. (she goes)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, bye.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye, see ya. (she goes)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(sitting down on the couch) Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right. So, how did it <b title='happen'>go</b> at the <b title='↗infertile, sterile, pregnant'>fertility</b> <b title='private or specialized hospital/place at which specialized medical treatment or advice is given to visiting patients'>clinic</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not as much fun as last time. <b title='used when the real situation is different from what you thought it was ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b> you only get <b title='pornography - writings, pictures, videos etc, designed to make people feel sexually excited'>porn</b> if you're giving a sperm sample.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So uh, so what'd the doctor say?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she just felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So you're <b title='rule out - decide that sth is not possible or suitable'>ruling out</b> surrogacy?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, I don't have to learn what that means?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='except for'>Aside from</b> adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Enough said, I'm there for you <b title='used to address sb ↗dude, pal, fella, buddy'>man</b>. Where is she, upstairs?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(stopping Joey) Ah-ha! Your <b title='having continued or existed for a long time'>long-standing</b> offer to have sex with my wife is appreciated. But I think I'll <b title='to not accept an invitation or offer'>pass</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, uh, how do you feel about all this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but, I don't think there is one.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on Ross, be a good guy. <b title='come forward'>Step up</b> and do it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='confused ↗bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>puzzled</b>) What?<br>
(Joey moves close to Ross and whispers something in his ear)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looking <b title='very surprised ↗amazed, stunned, astounded, dumbstruck, dumbfounded'>astonished</b>) What? NO! I am not gonna give them Ben!

<i>Professor Sherman</i>Mmm-mm.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a-a <b title='a basic fact that you accept as being true'>given</b>, but if they're <b title='away'>off</b> by <b title='The age of the Earth is 4.54 ± 0.05 billion years'>even</b> a hundred thousand years or so then you can-you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, <b title='exactly'>right</b> in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is-is, is that, (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that, uh the <b title='repercussion indirect effect or result ↗consequence, backfire'>repercussions</b> could, could be huge!

<i>Zack</i>(after a pause, very confused) No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Eh... Heart Disease, <b title='the most common form of dementia. There is no cure for the disease, which worsens as it progresses, and eventually leads to death [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimers">Wiki</a>]'>Alzheimers</b>, <b title='a disease which causes people&#039;s joints to swell painfully, esp in their toes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout">Wiki</a>]'>gout</b>?<br>
<i>Zack</i>You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We're just making conversation.<br>
<i>Zack</i>Yeah, well, ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what's not funny? <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Alopecia.jpg/230px-Alopecia.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_pattern_baldness">Wiki</a>]'>Male Pattern Baldness</b> (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)<br>
<i>Zack</i>All right listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm <b title='pleased because sb has shown you that they like or admire you'>flattered</b> and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?<br>
<i>Monica & Chandler</i>Sure! Alright.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!

<i>Charlie</i>(smiling) Rachel... I heard you two guys whispering.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(after a pause) Yeah.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>I just... I don't understand it. I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a <b title='a woman who likes to have sex very often, esp with lots of different men ↗whore, tramp'>nympho</b>!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(sighs with <b title='a feeling of comfort ↗relieved'>relief</b>) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.<br>

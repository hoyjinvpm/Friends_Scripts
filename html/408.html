<i>Chandler</i>(on phone) Hey, it's me. I know you <b title="=can't bear">can't stand</b> to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All... (Joey hangs up the phone in <b title='a strong feeling of dislike, annoyance, or disapproval'>disgust</b>.)<br>
(Pause)<br>
(The phone rings again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Answering phone) Hello.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look I never should've kissed your girlfriend, and I'm... (Joey hangs up the phone again.)<br>
(Pause)<br>
(The phone rings yet again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Answering phone) Stop calling!!<br>
<i>Voice</i>(on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, <b title='a radio station [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNOW-FM">Wiki</a>]'>WXRK,</b> <b title='a common radio brand [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Rock">Wiki</a>]'>K-Rock</b> calling for our $1,000 daily <b title='an invitation to compete or take part, eso in a game or argument ↗quiz'>challenge</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right!<br>
<i>Voice</i>What is the name of your <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b> who is very, very sorry and would do anything... (Joey realizes it's Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger and resumes to reading the magazine. )<br>
(The phone rings again)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='an expression of anger or annoyance ↗darn'>Damn it</b> Chandler! Stop calling!<br>
<i>Ross (on the phone)</i>Joey-Joey, it's Ross.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Sorry <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's all right.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-<b title='used in negative expressions to say that sth is not important, interesting, good etc'>not much</b>. Uh I got, I got Chandler here and he's really really sorry- (Joey realizes what is going on, hangs up the phone and goes back to reading his magazine.).
<s>Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey and Chandler are there getting ready for <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving">Wiki</a>]'>Thanksgiving</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(Entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So are things with you and Joey any better?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to <b title='make sb do sth'>get</b> him to talk to me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, wow, eight hours? So you <b title='could use - used to say sb/sth needs sth very much'>could probably really use</b> one of those plug-in telephone <b title='headset - a set of headphones, often with a microphone attached'>headsets</b> huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Should we all expect <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Wiki</a>]'>Christmas</b> gifts that can be stolen from your office?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You shouldn't.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do <b title='a Christmas tradition in which members of a group are randomly assigned a person to whom they anonymously give a gift. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa">Wiki</a>'>Secret Santa</b>, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of you know, who gets who.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don't know why I do that. But it is correct.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Reaches into the pocket of her <b title='sth that you wear to protect the front of your clothes, esp when you are cooking'>apron</b>). Hey, what's this? (Takes out the <b title='↗slip, coupon'>pieces of paper</b> with everybody's name on it) What, it's all of your names. (Puts the names in a bowl) Let's pick!<br>
(Phoebe reaches into the bowl of names as Joey enters)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey what's going....(sees Chandler; there's a pause; Joey starts to leave)<br>
<i>Everybody</i>No Joey!! Stay!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey <b title='used to tell sb to hurry up'>come on</b>! We're picking names for Secret Santa.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Phoebe pulls him back in) Ok.(shyly) I invented Secret Santa. You know?<br>
(Ross <b title='chuckle - laugh quietyly ↗giggle'>chuckles</b>)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What are you laughing at? You're the one who said <b title='a 1988 American action film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard">Wiki</a>]'>Die Hard</b> was your idea.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It was! Don't make me show you the <b title='↗sketch, [<a href="http://nodullmoments.com/2013/10/utf-8-explained-on-the-back-of-a-napkin/">UTF-8 explained on the back of a napkin</a>]'>napkin</b>!<br>
(Rachel reaches into the bowl of names)<br>
[Cut to later, the <b title='group of people'>gang</b>, <b title='without'>minus</b> Joey, is watching the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_Day_Parade">Wiki</a>]'>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b title='↗march, procession'>Parade</b>.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> take a <b title='a short sleep, esp during the day'>nap</b>, turkey makes me sleepy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We haven't eaten yet!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, And I just... (goes into her bedroom.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, <b title='used when you are asking questions to find out whether sth is true'>by any chance</b> did either of you pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, <b title='because'>'cause</b> I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='↗exchange'>trade</b> for her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! Why do you wanna get rid of her so badly?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that <b title='↗rucksack, knapback'>backpack</b> and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day that big dog ran off with it... (Notices the look on Monica and Phoebe's faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b> 'cause I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... (Phoebe looks <b title='↗puzzled, bewildered, bemused'>confused</b>.) Her <b title='Rachel Green ↗abbreviation, shorten, contraction'>initials</b>...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh. Ok, I'm really bad at initials.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh. (Makes a wow face)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow! You got your shopping done early this year.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah well my <b title='a coupon that is found within the box or pack of Camel cigarettes [<a href="http://www.ask.com/question/camel-cash">link</a>]'>Camel Cash</b> was about to expire so..<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe you can give it to somebody else. Ooh, like <b title='R.G.'>Ross Geller</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aw, you know what though, it's kind of a <b title='suitable for girls and women ↗girly, sissy, feminine, masculine'>girlie</b> briefcase.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who cares? He works in a museum!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is wrong with this <b title='↗fridge, refrigerator, compartment'>freezer</b>?! (She <b title='jab - push sth with a sudden straight movement ↗stab, jimmy, pry'>jabs</b> her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Oowah!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>God, what happened?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Open it up, let me see.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you know what, I can't, it really <b title='my head/back etc is killing me - used to say that a part of your body is hurting a lot'>kills</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well maybe you should <b title='↗irony'>put some ice on it</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, God, it looks bad.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's really <b title='sb who is picky only likes specific things and is not easily pleased ↗screen'>picky</b> about his patients.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you've <b title='got to'>gotta</b> go. What's his office number?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Like I remember his office number! (Pause) <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_dial">Wiki</a>]'>Speed dial</b> 7.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(on phone) Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke <b title='↗around'>in</b> today? (Listens) (to Monica) He's out of town, but does she wanna see the <b title='some types of workers, esp doctors, are described as being on call if they are available to make official visits at any time when they are needed, whether they are at home or at work ↗on duty, shift, standby'>on call</b> doctor?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes! She's very excited about that. Ok we'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> in. (Hangs up)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok,so,uh, who's gonna-who's gonna take her in?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'll go. You can watch the parade.<br>
(Chandler happily runs out of the kitchen and into the living room)<br>
[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So cool, <b title='=til, till'>'til</b> Monica gets back, it's like I'm <b title='chef - sb who cooks food in a restaurant as their job ↗head master/mistress, headman '>head chef</b> and I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the <b title='a set of instructions for cooking or preparing a particular food ↗cuisine'>recipe</b> exactly!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, get out of my kitchen!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Entering) All right! Ok! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he <b title='In Western culture, the finger (as in giving someone the finger), also known as the middle finger, roughly equivalent in meaning to "fuck off", "fuck you" or "shove it up your ass."

<i>Phoebe</i>All right I... I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> call my mom and ask her a <b title='↗left-handed compliment - a statement that seems to express admiration or praise, but at the same time is insulting. e.g. "They gave me a left-handed compliment when they said I was smart for a girl."

I'm gonna be in there (Points to Rachel's room) (Thinks about something) Awh, while I'm <b title='↗absent'>gone</b>.. (Ross and Chandler are confused as to what she is thinking about) (Thinks) Chandler, you're in charge! (Chandler becomes a bit excited as Phoebe goes to Rachel's room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So listen, ah, I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanukah">Wiki</a>] =Hanukkah'>Chanukah</b>, I was wondering if you wanna switch.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh you know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what-what're you gonna get me?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no-no-no, you don't wanna do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, that's not true! I got her lots of <b title='things'>stuff</b> she never took back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Like?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>When was the last time you saw her wear it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Big dog?
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of <b title='a strong feeling of shame and sadness because you know that you have done sth wrong'>guilt</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Everything? Even the TV?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! I'm putting that in my room.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Listen, Joey, uh, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least <b title='hear out - listen to all of what sb wants to tell you without interrupting them ↗listen up'>hear the guy out</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a good <b title='idea/opinion/reason'>point</b>. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Five years.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Joey, the guy's your best friend.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, was, my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're <b title='push for - try hard to get/achieve'>pushing for</b> him so hard. With him <b title='if sb/sth is out of the way, they are somewhere where they are not likely to cause a problem, need attention, be annoying etc'>out of the way</b> as my best friend, there's a <b title='position'>spot</b> open.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, who? Me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! I am <b title='proud that you have been given special respect or a special opportunity ↗flattering'>honored</b>! You know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'd <b title='make sb do sth'>get</b> you to talk to Chandler.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Look, it's not about her. Ok? But seeing you two together just reminds me what you did. And I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see you. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, look, I know, what it is to be a friend, I just-I <b title='screw up - make a bad mistake or do sth very stupid'>screwed up</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks <b title='very interested'>intrigued</b>) What?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Umm, so how long you've been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.<br>
<i>Tim</i>I moved back here a couple of months ago.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I know, it's <b title='causing or expressing unpleasant emotions ↗outrageous, disgusting'>sick</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Coming out of the bathroom) What's twisted?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Me going out with Richard's son.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Is he ok in there?<br>
<i>Joey</i>He's fine!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know, Mon, if things <b title='work out - prove effective or successful'>worked out</b> between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Fine! <b title='criticize'>Judge</b> all you want to but, (Points to Ross) married a <b title='↗homosexual, straight, gay, come out (of the closet)'>lesbian</b>, (Points to Rachel) left a man at the <b title='a special table where religious ceremonies are performed, esp in a Christian church'>altar</b>, (Points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (Points to Joey) threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, (Points to Chandler) living in a box!! (Goes to her room)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So now, what exactly is the <b title='idea/opinion/reason'>point</b> of the box?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The meaning of the box is <b title='three times as much'>threefold</b>. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And-and if he stays in the box you guys would be friends again?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Let's just say it's a start.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Worried) Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just wanna check something.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (She goes into her bedroom)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What did you get?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title="One example would be a retail clothing store. If a customer returns some clothing, the store might give the customer in-store credit instead of cash [<a href='http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_in_store_credit'>link</a>]">Credit</b>.<br>
(There's a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Running in from her bedroom) I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! (Opens the door) Hi, Tim.<br>
<i>Tim</i>Hi. (Gives her a bottle of wine)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. Ok, come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.<br>
<i>Tim</i>Hi, nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Tim</i>Hi, Joey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>My brother, Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) That's Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How do you do.<br>
<i>Tim</i>What's...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, well, he's...<br>
<i>Joey</i>He's doing some thinking!<br>
[Cut to later, Joey, Rachel, Ross, and Tim are watching the football game, and they all cheer loudly.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What happened? What happened?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You kissed my girlfriend!<br>
(A <b title='↗ad, infomercial'>commercial</b> for <b title='↗ultra violet, infra red, goggle, glare'>sunglasses</b> comes on.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, I like those sunglasses.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Like <b title='them'>'em</b>, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Va' fa Napoli! (Joey nods his approval.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right everybody, this turkey is ready!<br>
<i>Tim</i>Where can I wash up?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Here, let me show you. Ok, the towels are hanging next to the <b title='↗basin, toilet'>sink</b>, and umm, you can use the <b title='expensive/fashionable'>fancy</b> soap.<br>
<i>Tim</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Fancy soap? I thought we were saving that for <b title='the leader of the Roman Catholic Church [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope">Wiki</a>]'>the Pope</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='You see - used when you are explaining sth'>See</b> he's nice. Right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but Monica, do you really wanna be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to <b title='do it - have sex'>do it</b>."<br>
<i>Tim</i>Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.<br>
(There's a loud knocking.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I'll get it. (goes over to the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="a word meaning 'I've got you' used when you catch sb or trick them in some way">Gotcha</b>! (laughs)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That doesn't sound like thinking to me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know I don't think you should be talking <b title='used to make negatives and questions stronger'>at all</b> in there! I think you got too much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, ok, <b title="Sure/You're correct.">you got it</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, can you pass me the <b title='a type of sweet potato [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAM#Plants_and_foods">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Ipomoea_batatas_006-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Ipomoea_batatas_006.JPG/220px-Ipomoea_batatas_006.JPG"> <img src="225px-Dioscorea_opposita_(batatas)-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Dioscorea_opposita_%28batatas%29.jpg/225px-Dioscorea_opposita_%28batatas%29.jpg">'>yams</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Will you stop?! What is the matter with you?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh-ho-ho, we've got <b title='a guest/guests'>company</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely <b title='lacking'>devoid</b> of <b title='gentle feelings such as sympathy, love etc'>sentiment</b>, see, I have feelings.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)<br>
(An awkward silence follows)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You can't <b title='know'>tell</b>, but I'm trying to break the tension by <b title='moon - show your naked bottom to someone as an insult or a joke'>mooning</b> you guys!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an <b title='↗retarded, moron, imbecile'>idiot</b> in a box!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're right, I'm sorry! This-this means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So are you gonna start <b title='take - consider/accept'>taking</b> this thing seriously?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗definitely, certainly'>Absolutely</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There's no response from Chandler.) Ok.<br>
(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Don't say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what's in the box.) This is a movie <b title='the part of a ticket that is given back to you after it has been torn'>stub</b> from our first <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum the first time we... were together. Ok, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It's like <b title='↗fossil'>a million years old</b>, we, we actually, we have people looking for that.<br>
(Rachel <b title='gaze, stare, glimpse, glance'>glares</b> at him.)<br>
[Cut to the balcony Monica goes onto the <b title='a platform on the outside of a building, above ground level ↗patio, porch, terrace'>balcony</b>.]<br>
<i>Tim</i>Hey...mind if I smoke?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Care if I die? No. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Go ahead and smoke. (Putting on her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)<br>
<i>Tim</i>Here, let me help. (Does so.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Tim</i>You-you have a very beautiful... <b title='↗eyes'>eye</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know all my friends think this is weird.<br>
<i>Tim</i>Even the one in the box?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's not weird, is it?<br>
<i>Tim</i>You know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.<br>
<i>Tim</i>Oh, I totally agree.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean, we're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?<br>
(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica <b title='pull away - move your body or part of your body away from sb/sth ↗back away, retreat, recoil'>pulls away</b>.)<br>
<i>Tim</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing. Nothing.<br>
<i>Tim</i>No-no really, was-was that not ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...<br>
<i>Tim</i>Oh my God! It didn't <b title='↗ring a bell, memorize, learn by heart'>remind</b> you of...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Interrupting) Oh don't say it!<br>
<i>Tim</i>No, but it did! Didn't it?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Tim</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>!!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know!<br>
(They both <b title='↗tremble, shake'>shiver</b> in horror.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my god. I am sorry, I am..so sorry.<br>
<i>Tim</i>It's ok. I mean, it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without a little emotional <b title="scar - leave a permanent mark on sb's skin as the result of an injury ↗gauze">scarring</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. You know what's even worse? My friends were right.<br>
<i>Tim</i>You know what the worst thing is for me, is that you actually remind me of a younger version of... my mom.<br>
(Monica quickly turns around.)<br>
[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. There's a knock on the door.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'll get it. (It's Kathy.)<br>
<i>Kathy</i>(Sees it's Joey) Oh.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's ok. Chandler's the one I'm mad at so-<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Well, I'm-I'm still sorry. Is he here?<br>
<i>Joey</i>In the box.<br>
<i>Kathy</i>(Going over to the box) Chandler?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, he-he can't talk <b title='at the present time ↗by now, right away'>right now</b>.<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Why not? What's going on?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well he's-he's trying to show Joey how much he means to him.<br>
<i>Kathy</i>By being in a box?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey had reasons.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They were threefold.<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk might actually make this, easier. Listen umm... (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the <b title='sth that you say to show what you are thinking or feeling, without saying it directly ↗imply, suggest'>hint</b> and leave them alone.) Listen, I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't <b title='accept a situation'>stand</b> seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the <b title='reason'>cause</b> of that. So, I don't think we can see each other <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>. I'm gonna go to my mom's, in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Wiki</a>] <img src="300px-Chicago_montage1-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Chicago_montage1.jpg/300px-Chicago_montage1.jpg"> <img src="270px-Illinois_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Illinois_in_United_States.svg/270px-Illinois_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Chicago</b>, I'm gonna stay there for a while. (Pause) I think this could've be something really amazing, but you know this is probably <b title='If an action is for the best, it is done to improve a situation or produce a good result, although it might seem unpleasant at the time'>for the best</b>. You know? I'm gonna miss you. Goodbye, Chandler.<br>
(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves goodbye with one finger extended through the air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get <b title='out of'>outta</b> there!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, you did some real good thinking in there.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Man, this is...<br>
(Joey says something <b title='↗clear, incomprehensible, incoherent, tongue-tied'>unintelligible</b> and they <b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from your Secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)<br>
(After he's gone.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
<s>Monica and Rachel's Balcony, the gang is all there watching Chandler.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, he sees her!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, he's <b title='catch up - go faster so that you reach the person or vehicle in front of you'>catching up</b> to her!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!<br>
<i>Ross</i>He's taking her <b title='hangbag ↗rob, mug'>purse</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, there they are!<br>
(They watch them <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b> and sigh)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, <b title='↗do it, consummate, (sexual) intercourse'>get a room</b>.<br>

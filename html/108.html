<i>Ross</i>Wher- Can we focus? Please!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Goodbye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Bye, Nana.<br>
(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in disbelief. Monica runs out of the room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross!<br>
(Ross runs out too.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>What is going on?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had-had <b title='use "pass away" when you want to avoid saying the word "die"'>passed</b>? Well, she's not, quite..<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no, she's gone.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We checked. A lot.<br>

<i>Mrs. Geller</i>I'm not sure I know what you<b title='be getting at sth - be trying to say sth in a way that is difficult for other people to understand'>'re getting at</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you think things would've been better if you'd just told her the truth?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just <b title='if people get along, they have a friendly relationship'>get along</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>More wine, dear?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I think so.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(reaches out to <b title='move or touch sth that does not belong to you, in an annoying way ↗mess, fumble'>fiddle</b> with Monica's hair again, and realizes) Those earrings look really lovely on you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. They're yours.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Actually they were Nana's.<br>

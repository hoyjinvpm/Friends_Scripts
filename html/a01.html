<s>Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's room. Monica still has her big, <b title='frizzy hair has small tight stiff curls'>frizzy</b> hair.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, the way you <b title='crush - injure/kill'>crushed</b> Mike at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis">Wiki</a>]'>ping pong</b> was such a <b title='sth that makes you feel sexually attracted or excited ↗arouse'>turn-on</b>.You <b title='want to'>wanna</b>.? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I-I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'll put a pillowcase over my head.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're <b title='scheduled, planned'>on</b>!<br>
(They start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's room)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, ok, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no <b title='rule or set of rules'>law</b> against. <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> we're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> grab some food, so, if you want.<br>
(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some <b title='unclear ↗unintelligible, incomprehensible'>indistinct</b> <b title='murmur - say sth in a very quiet voice'>murmuring</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Finally.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Is that Ross?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sounds like he's with someone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He could be alone. This morning I heard him do <b title='push-up - an exercise in which you lie on the floor on your chest and push yourself up with your arms ↗sit-up, push-up, chin-up, pull-up'>push-ups</b>, and then talk to his <b title='the muscle at the back of your upper arm ↗biceps, abs, pecs'>triceps</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.<br>
(They all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Ooh. Dr. Geller!<br>
<i>Ross</i>God, you're amazing. I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, that's Charlie!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She's <b title='cheat on - secretly have sex with sb other than your husband, wife, or partner'>cheating on</b> Joey with Ross!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='sb, usu a female, that is a show-off (who always tries to show how clever or skilled they are ) or just a stupid bimbo (an attractive but not very intelligent young woman)'>tart</b>, <b title='a woman with a reputation for promiscuity (having many sexual partners) ↗slut, tramp, whore, prostitute, hooker'>floozy</b>, giant.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm not sure about this.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you-you're right. This is none of our business.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I'm not gonna do this, ok? I'm not gonna <b title="listen to other people's conversation without them knowing that you are listening ↗listen in, overhear">eavesdrop</b> on my friend.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(through wall) Ooh. I love <b title='an island country in the Caribbees. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados">Wiki</a>]'>Barbados</b>! <br>
(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There, Joey and Rachel are kissing.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh. I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I'm her!<br>
(They start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Get over here!<br>
(Chandler and Monica take a <b title='a short race at a fast speed ↗spring, rush, dive, swoop, plunge'>sprint</b> to the other wall)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(in her Monica-excited-way. TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!<br>
(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing. We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair <b title='stuff - push sth soft into a space or container'>stuffed</b> in her mouth by Chandler.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='not easy to hear because it is blocked by sth'>muffled</b>) Thank you.<br>
(Rachel and Joey's)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, you know, <b title='at an earlier time ↗then, once'>before</b> you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, <b title="I'm in no position to say/judge/criticize sth">who am I to talk</b>?<br>
(Chandler and Monica's)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No one is <b title='man - work at, use, or operate a system, piece of equipment etc'>manning</b> that wall!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm on it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Anything?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think I hear curtains closing. <br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We've got shoes being kicked off over here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bed <b title='spring - a long thin piece of metal in the shape of a coil that quickly returns to its original shape after you stretch it and let it go <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Springs_009.jpg/200px-Springs_009.jpg">'>springs</b>, unmistakable!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> realise that's your brother?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute. Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with <b title='an American singer-songwriter, musician, parodist, record producer, satirist, music video director, film producer, actor, and author [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-AlYankovicByKristineSlipson-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/AlYankovicByKristineSlipson.jpg/220px-AlYankovicByKristineSlipson.jpg">'>Weird Al</b>.<br>

<i>Charlie</i>Ok.<br>
(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to Ross and Charlie's)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's the door. He's gone.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!<br>
(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what're you guys doing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, we're just. we're sad to go, so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (<b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hugs</b> the wall) I love you. Paradise Hotel, Golf <b title='a place that many people go to for a vacation'>resort</b> and <b title='a place with a natural supply of mineral water where people go because the water is considered to improve health'>spa</b>. (she walks away from the wall)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title="to move your hands gently over sb's face or body in a way that shows you love them ↗stroke, feel up, grope">caresses</b> the wall with his finger) Bye!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, uhm. Hey, have you guys seen Joey anywhere?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it. (walks to Phoebe and Monica)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, if you see him, could you please tell him I'm looking for him?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='I agree to what you asked; You will get what you want'>You got it</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Other wall, people! Other wall!<br>
(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God, that's Ross. What are we gonna do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, ju-ju-just be calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b> together. Right? Just be <b title='behaving in a calm manner ↗casual, breezy'>nonchalant</b>. (Joey like <b title='↗(stand) at ease'>stands at attention</b> with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips <b title='pout - push the lower lip forward'>pouted</b>.) That's not nonchalant!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No idea what it means.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Ok, just hide!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(knocks) Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!<br>
(When Rachel starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens the door between the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Is everything ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know where Joey is?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I really don't. (looks around again)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Can I talk to you for a minute?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, sure. (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)<br>
(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed against the wall, and Joey looks at them)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't believe this. Have you guys been-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Shhh! This is the listening side of the wall.<br>
(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door, which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>And then she told me that she and Joey had <b title='↗dump'>broken up</b>, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh. right. yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And-and you know I wanted to <b title='ask sb out - ask sb to go to a restaurant, movie etc with you ↗go out'>ask Charlie out</b> since the day I met her.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(now looking up at the ceiling) That is <b title='difficult to be certain'>hard to say</b>, Ross. That is hard to say.<br>

(Ross leaves the room)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Is he gone?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(still can't find him) How're you doing this?<br>
(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are following him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pssst.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How. wha. Hey! What're you. What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?<br>
<i>Monica, Chandler and Phoebe</i>YE-AH!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Now, wh-what is this?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah, what is this? Well, let's see, we-we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No no. Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, he's with Charlie now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(long pause and he twitches a bit) You<b title="be a pain (in sb's/the neck/ass etc) - be very annoying">'re a pain in my ass</b>, Geller!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, look, you guys. Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='pronounce words or parts of words clearly and carefully'>Enunciate</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Get out!<br>
(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are they right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should. <b title='delay ↗put off'>hold off</b> until we talk to Ross.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I, I think that'd be best. So, so I'm gonna. I'm gonna <b title='leave'>take off</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Joey walks to the door) Although. <br>
<i>Joey</i>(turns around very fast) I like although!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean, you know. Ross and I haven't <b title='date - have a romantic relationship with sb'>dated</b> in like. six years.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Six years? Wow. It's almost as long as high school.<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title='↗definitely, certainly'>Absolutely</b>! He's not thinking about you.<br>

<i>Joey</i>I'm thinking about you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Let's forget about Ross.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='↗done'>Forgotten</b>.<br>
(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel <b title='withdraw, retreat ↗recoil'>pulls back</b> quickly, <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasping</b>)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Joey's voice, but she sees Ross</i>Seriously. What is it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing. It's really. It's nothing. Come here, come here.<br>
(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)<br>
<i>Joey's voice/Ross</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sorry, I just uhm. I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses. Ross in Rachel's dress. He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)<br>
<i>Rachel/Ross</i>Ooh, your lips are so soft. Do that again. (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, we-we, we need to talk to Ross, yeah.<br>
<i>Both</i>Yeah.

<i>Ross</i>Learn about Jesus.<br>
(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>So, did you talk to Joey?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, no. no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Em. Sounds like a good idea. Dr. Geller!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Stop it!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>P..H..D.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're <b title='very offensive, usually because of dealing with sex in an unpleasant way ↗obscene, lewd, dirty'>filthy</b>!<br>
(Phoebe enters)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, have you guys seen Monica?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright.<br>
(Monica enters, with her hair <b title='braid =plait. If you plait three or more lengths of hair, rope, or other material together, you twist them over and under each other to make one thick length. ↗ponytail, pigtail'>braided</b> and little shells at the end)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Hey! Aaaaahhh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do you think?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think.. I think I can see your <b title="the skin on the sb's of your head">scalp</b>.<br>

<i>Charlie</i>It's said. something. <b title='↗You go girl - used to show encouragement'>You go girlfriend</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You've never said that in your life, have you?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Not once.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I thought so.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm so glad you did that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, and listen to this. (shakes her body so the shells <b title='make a clear, high, ringing noise ↗rattle, clink'>tinkle</b>)<br>

<s>Boarding the plane.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uh. <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, it's almost <b title='used to give a possible explanation for sth =as though'>as if</b> Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I uh, I mean, I. dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I understand.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Allen_Iverson_headshot.jpg/220px-Allen_Iverson_headshot.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Iverson">Wiki</a>]'>Allen Iverson</b> over there.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>No, I think I can <b title='↗come by, drop by, stop by'>come over</b>. It's Saturday, right?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Uhm. I can't-can't do anything tonight.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I have a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You have a. You have, you have a date? With who?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh, it's. my girlfriend.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='let go - stop holding'>lets go</b> of his hand) You have. have a girlfriend?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah. Well, when. you and I broke up I started <b title='be seeing sb - be having a romantic relationship with sb'>seeing</b> someone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>For how long?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Three months.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Three months? Ok. This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I-I promise.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, ok, good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.<br>
(cut to Monica and Chandler)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, it's our last <b title='short look ↗glance'>glimpse</b> of Barbados.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And my last glimpse of anything.<br>
(cut to Charlie and Ross)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the <b title='↗stewardess, air hostess'>flight attendant</b> says "duty free".<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Ok. Um. Good luck.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know if he's not ok with this, then nothing more can happen between us.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>I know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well that's the case I just want you to know that I think I could've <b title='fall for - fall in love with'>fallen for</b> you really really hard. On the other hand, if he is ok with us, then, you know, what's causal whatever.<br>
(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Oh I guess so. I'm just. really nervous.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Still nervous?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, I um. I kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, last night after you guys broke up. so sorry to hear about that by the way. Well, Charlie and I were talking, and. well.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You kissed.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wha. (gasps) What? What-what-what would give you that idea?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I saw you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, we kissed, but. nothing else. nothing else happened, ok?<br>

<i>Ross</i>No, I, <b title='used to add emphasis to what you are saying'>I mean it</b>. I mean, you are so, you are so loyal, <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>, and selfless, and generous.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I am those things, yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now. I may have to rethink some <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dude!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Thanks!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="↗you're welcome, sure, not at all, no problem">Yeah</b>.<br>
(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Well, I-I'm so excited about this.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? Excited?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you kidding? I have had some very <b title='dealing with sex'>dirty</b> dreams about this.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take <b title='them'>'em</b> all back. I'm <b title='edge - advantage ↗have the edge over'>on an edge on</b> Chandler.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, <b title='used to tell sb that sth is not important and they do not need to worry about it'>forget it</b>. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Alright. Susie, can I call you Susie?<br>
<i>Precious</i>My name is Precious.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I can't say that. Uhm. Susie, I'm gonna be <b title='honest and true ↗blunt, get sth straight, put/set sb straight'>straight</b> with you. Mike and I are back together. and uhm. unfortunately that <b title='e.g. "With Australia 24 points ahead at halftime, the game was effectively over."; "The region was effectively independent."'>effectively</b> ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry, about that and wishes you the <b title='formal language. [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080103115004AAEiXyH">link</a>] endeavor - attemp to do sth new/difficult'>best of luck in all your endeavours</b>.<br>
<i>Precious</i>I just can't believe this. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I don't.<br>
<i>Precious</i>Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.<br>
<i>Precious</i>I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='an expression of anger or annoyance'>Damn it</b> woman, <b title='calm yourself [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080202221428AA2P4CA">link</a>]'>pull yourself together</b>! Have some pride, for the love of God.<br>
(Precious starts crying)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, not a fan of the <b title='difficult'>tough</b> love.<br>
<i>Precious</i>I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and <b title='propose - suggest or offer marriage ↗engagement'>proposing</b> to me.<br>
<i>Precious</i>He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look, Precious. Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's <b title='admit a problem exists'>face</b> it, Mike's kind of a <b title='penis'>wang</b>. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you. He was gonna break up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to <b title='talking publicly about your relationship with sb'>kiss-and-tell</b>, but he <b title='cheat on - be unfaithful to your husband, wife, or sexual partner'>cheated on</b> you a lot this weekend.<br>
<i>Precious</i>Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.<br>
(Mike enters the apartment.)<br>
<i>Precious</i><b title='used for expressing your anger ↗fuck you'>Screw you</b>, Mike. You're a <b title='↗chicken, wuss'>coward</b> and a <b title='an unpleasant person'>bastard</b>, and I hope you <b title='suffer or be punished for a long time'>rot in hell</b>. <br>
(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he doesn't believe what just happened. Precious leaves, and he turns to Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used as a polite reply to thanks (As if Mike said, "Thank you for help me make the break-up so fast")'>You're welcome!</b>
<s>Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks to the bathroom.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, you've been in there for a long time. Is everything ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="weaker 'no'. ↗not so much, no way, nah, nope">Not really</b>. <br>
(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I have a problem.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? What happened?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I was dancing around, and singing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Woman,_No_Cry">Wiki</a>]'>"No Woman, No Cry"</b> and, I got stuck.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You can't move at all?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, well I can move. (she moves back and forth the shower curtain <b title='a metal bar used for hanging clothes etc on'>rail</b>, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If I <b title='separate things that are twisted around each other'>untangle</b> you, will you please get rid of the cornrows?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(looking disappointed) I guess so.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little <b title='with fibers that are coming apart'>frayed</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I tried to <b title='bite repeatedly ↗chew'>gnaw</b> myself free.
<s>Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, did you err. did you tell Ross?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It-it's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go: I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Alright, alright, ok, uhm. How about this, how about this? Tomorrow. tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, that sounds fair. That just means that once again we can't.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know, I know., but that's ok. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Goo-ood night!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Seriously, good night!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Stop saying good night.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
(Now they kiss passionately. and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze, <b title='move away or backward'>pull away</b> and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing. Joey <b title='straighten - make sth straight ↗weaken, strengthen'>straightens</b> his shirt, and Rachel says I'm so-oo sorry, and presses her breasts together, just like Joey did before.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastacap">Wiki</a>]'>Rasta hats</b>.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Look what I found in the drawer. (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Now that I untangled you, how about you doing a little something for me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure, what do you have in mind?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think you know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? I don't-I don't really feel like it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is what I want to do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I just don't get why you like it so much.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an FBI agent, <b title='pose - pretend to be'>posing</b> as a beauty contestant.<br>

{How big a deal is "that big of a deal"?<br>
Most Americans have heard people say both, "It's not that big a deal," and "It's not that big of a deal;" many people are not certain which of the two constructions is considered correct. "It's not that big a deal is correct, meaning that it is acceptable in all registers of English. "It's not that big of a deal" is a false partitive, generally considered ungrammatical. It is unacceptable in both formal and written English.<br>
The word "big" is an adjective; as such it is not entitled to govern a prepositional phrase. In the sentence, "It's not that big a deal," "big" modifies, or describes, "deal." The sentence could be rewritten as "It's not a deal that big," or "The deal is not that big." It is neither necessary nor permissible to insert "of" into the sentence.

<i>Rachel</i>I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! <b title='Caroline, Princess of Hanover, Hereditary Princess of Monaco. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Caroline">Wiki</a>]'>Princess Caroline</b>?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're jealous of Princess Caroline?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Do I have my own castle?<br>
(Joey and Ross enter.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(noticing the bag Joey's carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?<br>
(Joey and Ross exchange looks.)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='You sort of need tissues when you are watching a porn.'>Sort of...</b><br>
<i>Monica</i>Guys, what's going on?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh... (holds up the movie) Phoebe's a porn star!<br>
<i>All</i>What?!<br>
(They all run over to Joey and Ross, Chandler grabs the movie and reads the title.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe Buffay in <b title='Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American TV series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_The_Vampire_Slayer">Wiki</a>] slay - kill. lay - put sb/sth down / have sex. vampire - a dead person that sucks people&#039;s blood by biting their necks.'>Buffay: The Vampire Layer</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>My God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well down at the adult video place on <b title='a street in Manhattan, located between Houston Street and 3rd Street, near to Washington Square Park'>Bleecker</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And-and I, and I saw Joey <b title='be about to do sth - be going to do sth'>was about to</b> go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> I pretended I didn't know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! I mean, I just- I can't, I can't believe this. You know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been <b title='to some degree, slightly'>somewhat</b> of a question mark.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is so <b title='very unusual or strange ↗weird'>bizarre</b>. I guess it kinda <b title='↗logical, reasonable, sensible'>makes sense</b> <b title='however'>though</b>, you know she had such a terrible childhood.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes, but you are dead inside.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right well, I'd better take that back.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wh-what, why?<br>
<i>Joey</i>We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah you're right, we can't- we shouldn't watch this.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Absolutely not.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn't let him grab it) You know maybe a little bit!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Probably just the first half.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! Hey no! This is wrong, you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! <b title='used to show approval'>Good for you</b> Joe!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
(Ross stands next to him for a second, then goes and watches the movie.)<br>
(The movie starts, it's a vampire's <b title='the room or home of a frightening or dangerous person'>lair</b> and Buffay, The Vampire Layer enters dressed in leather and carrying a wooden <b title='pointed stick'>stake</b>. Suddenly, the vampire opens his <b title='casket'>coffin</b> and sits up.<br>
<i>Buffay, the Vampire Layer</i>Ah, I thought I'd find you here, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu">Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-NosferatuShadow-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/NosferatuShadow.jpg/250px-NosferatuShadow.jpg">'>Nosferatu</b>.<br>
<i>The Vampire</i>Buffay, are you going to <b title='push sth firmly and deeply into sth else'>plunge</b> your stake into my dark places?<br>
<i>Buffay, the Vampire Layer</i>Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be <b title="with the order reversed (Nosferatu plunge his stake into Buffay's dark place.)">the other way around</b>.<br>
(At this point, Buffay, the Vampire Layer and Nosferatu start to <b title='have sex'>get it on</b>. Of course, since this is network TV, we can only see the reactions of the <b title='a group of people'>gang</b> to the film playing off screen.)<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='wait'>Hold on</b> a second! What is that on her ankle?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Her ankle is what you're watching?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it's hard to tell... (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she's having some trouble.) Oh God, she <b title='used to express a wish'>would</b> <b title='used for emphasis'>just</b> stop moving.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She's just doing her job!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, it's a <b title='a permanent image, pattern or word on the skin [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo">Wiki</a>] ↗taboo'>tattoo</b>! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is <b title="Phoebe's twin sister">Ursula</b>!<br>
(Upon hearing this, Joey can't turn his chair around fast enough and knocks it over.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey! Oh. <b title="'Is there anything new?'">What's up?</b> (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is reading <b title='a series of books. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Soup_for_the_Soul">Wiki</a>]'>Chicken Soup for the Soul</b> as Monica enters.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey sweetie!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's no back to this couch!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why are you reading this? You <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> this kind of <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah I know, what if I <b title='think'>figure</b> I give it a <b title='try, attempt'>shot</b> you know? May-maybe one of those stories make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was you know, <b title='completely'>all</b> dead inside.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>! Chandler, I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh that makes me feel so warm in my <b title='↗The Wonderful Wizard of Oz [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">Wiki</a>]'>hollow tin chest</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Stop it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the <b title='the area furthest from the entrance of a church, where the priest or minister stands'>altar</b> and I'm like this. (Makes a bored face.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I won't care, because I know that you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one day, and the doctor hands it to you in the <b title='↗labor, contraction'>delivery</b> room and you don't cry, so what?! And-and-and, and if we take him to college, we come home and, we see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, won't matter to me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. And-and you know if I die, from a long illness. And you're <b title='write out - write, esp carefully/formally/officially etc ↗help out - help'>writing out</b> my <b title='a speech at a funeral about the person who has died ↗gravestone, tombstone'>eulogy</b> and you open the desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't <b title='shed tears - cry. shed - drop/fall ↗sense the tone'>shed one tiny tear</b>, I know you'll be crying a river inside.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aww, I love you so...<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is wrong with you?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?! Now, I left you a note from <b title='whatever comes after this life'>the beyond</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So you didn't mean any of that?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, you <b title='↗android, cyborg'>robot</b>!
<s>Ross's apartment, his doorbell is ringing and he's running to answer it while <b title='do up - fasten ↗shoelace, shoestring, tie, zipper, fly'>doing up</b> his pants.</s>
<i>Ross</i>You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I-I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really <b title='take a liking to - begin to like'>taken a liking to</b> me. (Quickly looks out to see if they're watching.) Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?<br>
<i>Jill</i>Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm ok with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Aw, of course, what-what happened? (Lets her in.)<br>
<i>Jill</i>(entering) I don't wanna talk about it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, umm...<br>
<i>Jill</i>But you know what might really cheer me up?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Jill</i>Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! Really?!<br>
<i>Jill</i>Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand">Wiki</a>]'>sand</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I'd love to! Here, o you-you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!<br>
<i>Jill</i>Oh, great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh!<br>
(He goes into another room to get his projector and notes. While he's gone, Jill quickly checks her makeup.<br>
[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I haven't.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.<br>
(She goes to look out the window at Ross's apartment and sees Jill staring at her and closing the drapes with an evil look on her face. Rachel is <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak ↗dumbfounded, dumbstruck, astounded, astonished'>stunned</b> into silence.)
<s>Ursula's apartment, Phoebe is going to <b title='accuse sb of doing sth'>confront</b> her twin about her new porn career.</s>
<i>Ursula</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's Phoebe! Phoebe!<br>
(Ursula opens the door and is all <b title='dress up - wear formal or fancy (fashionable and expensive) clothes'>dressed up</b> with big hair and <b title="women's underwear [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingerie'>Wiki</a>]">lingerie</b>.)<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Hey!<br>

<i>Ursula</i>No, I'm not.<br>

<i>Ursula</i>Yeah, can I help you with something?<br>
<i>Same Man's Voice</i>Phoebe, come on!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look, I'm talking right now! You're- you mean her.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>You know, twin stuff is always a real <b title='↗popular, hit, good/bad/poor seller'>big seller</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Uh ok, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.<br>
<i>Jill</i>Oh, great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(answering it) Hello?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>O-ok, Rach calm-calm down, ok? She-she's really upset, we're just talking.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to <b title='do sth to hurt or harm sb who has hurt or harmed you ↗avenge, revenge, reciprocate'>get back at</b> me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, so that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I <b title='arrange for a concert, play etc to take place, or to perform in it'>put on</b> uh, a great slide show!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, <b title='used for emphasis'>I am telling</b> you she is using you to get back at me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? I think I can take care of myself, all right, I'll talk to you later. Goodbye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh, that-that was your sister. Actually, she-she thinks that you're just using me.<br>

<i>Joey</i>That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no! No! I-I know how to handle it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he's seen her before.) (To him) You're trying to <b title='think, to find the answer'>figure out</b> where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Ok? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.)

<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) Shhhh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See? Look at us, right now, not kissing!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗hear me out'>Let me finish</b>, ok? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! You know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh what-what- But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I-I realize if anything <b title='be to - used to talk about arrangements for the future'>were to</b> happen with me and Jill then nothing could <b title='at any time'>ever</b> happen with us!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us, again, ever. But I don't wanna know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.<br>

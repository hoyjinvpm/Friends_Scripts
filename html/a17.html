A baby!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. Oh wait, Ross doesn't know know the baby's coming. Should we call him and tell him?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Wait. Wait. Should we be doing this? <br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I don't know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, It's probably not a really good idea. <br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, probably not.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, that never stopped us <b title='at an earlier time ↗then'>before</b>. <br>
<i>Ross</i>No, sir!
<s>The hospital.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Aw, I can't believe in a couple of hours we're gonna be parents.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe it's three weeks early. I love that our baby is <b title='acting quickly'>prompt</b>. Ok. All right, what room did the nurse say Erica was in?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, 702.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.

<i>A man</i>Come on, baby.<br>
<i>A woman</i>Come on, Michelle.<br>
<i>The man</i>Come on. You can do this, baby.<br>
<i>Michelle</i>Get this <b title='used for emphasis'>damn</b> thing out of me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, these are for you. (to Monica) Did you see the size of the thing that was coming out of that woman?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I couldn't <b title='recognize difference'>tell</b> who was giving birth to who.
<s>The delivery room at the hospital. Monica, Chandler and Erica are there.</s>
<i>Erica</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey. How's it <b title='go - happen'>going</b>?<br>
<i>Erica</i>It's ok. The doctor says it'll still be a while.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How do you feel?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Well, it hurts sometimes. Not too bad yet, <b title='however; despite this'>though</b>. It's a little scary.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh I know. But honey, you're gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Tell that to lady in 702 with the <b title='a very young child who is just learning to walk'>toddler</b> coming out of her. I think that kid was wearing a shirt. You're gonna be fine, though.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Shhh... Go back to sleep. I have to go home.<br>

<i>Monica</i>To use the <b title="↗restroom, men's room, ladies' room">bathroom</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You can't leave me alone with her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is exactly the kind of social situation, that I am not comfortable with!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You'll be fine. <b title='No ↗nope, not really, not so much'>Nah</b>, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
(Monica leaves, and Chandler closes the door. Erica just looks at him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, ah... Any plans for the summer?<br>
<i>Erica</i>I don't know. Maybe church-<b title='a place where young people go to take part in activities, and where they usu stay for several days or weeks'>camp</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the <b title='testicles (the two round male sex organs that hang in a bag of skin behind the penis), balls, 00 of 007'>nuts</b>?<br>
<i>Erica</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will <b title='at any time'>ever</b> know, because no one can experience both.<br>
(Erica just looks at him like he's crazy.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters. Joey is holding a baby duck.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Come in.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Have you seen him throw a ball?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Is Rachel here?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, I think she's still asleep. Yeah. Hey hey hey hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> <b title='very angry or annoyed ↗mad'>pissed</b> at you.<br>

<i>Joey</i>So what's that mean? Are you guys getting back together?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I.. I don't know. I mean we didn't really <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> talk.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But do you wanna get back together?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. It was <b title='extremely good =unbelievable'>incredible</b>. I mean, it just felt, so right. When I was holding her, I-I mean, I, I never wanted to <b title='let go - stop holding'>let her go</b>. You know what? Yeah, I do. I-I wanna be together.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Shhh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(quietly) Yay!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, so is she still going to Paris?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I-I hope not.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again!

<i>Rachel</i>You too. Last night was just wonderful.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, it really was.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh. I know. It was just, uh, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hugs</b> him, and Ross looks <b title='crush - make sb feel extremely upset or shocked'>crushed</b>.)
<s>The Hospital. Erica is <b title='moan - make a long low sound because of pain, sadness, or pleasure =groan'>moaning</b> and about to give birth. Monica, Chandler, a nurse and a doctor are there with her.</s>
<i>Monica</i>It's just a little bit more, honey.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Help me and this hurts!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is it really that bad?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!<br>
(Monica gives Chandler a look.)<br>
<i>Doctor</i>The baby's head is <b title='crown - reach a stage in labor when a large segment of the fetal (related to a fetus) scalp (the skin on the top of your head) is visible at the vaginal (relating to vagina) orifice (hole)'>crowning</b>.<br>
(Monica walks down to Erica's legs to watch the birth.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!<br>
(Chandler is standing by Erica's head.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the <b title='an unusual and mysterious event'>miracle</b> of life!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Alright. Wow, that is one <b title='extremely unpleasant, very bad or shocking ↗appalling, outrageous'>disgusting</b> miracle.<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Start pushing. <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>Here we go</b>. Here come the shoulders...<br>
(The baby starts crying, and the doctor holds it up.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's a... It's a boy!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Erica</i>Is he ok?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>He's <b title='used for emphasis'>just</b> fine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, <b title='↗good for you, well done'>you did it</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other <b title='things'>stuff</b> I'm gonna pretend I don't see.<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Would you like to cut the <b title='a long tube that connects a baby to its mother before it is born and through which it receives food and oxygen. It is cut immediately after birth'>umbilical cord</b>?<br>
(A nurse gives Monica a pair of scissors. Monica gives it to Chandler, and they cut it together.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, that's <b title='resembling a sponge in elasticity etc -y - having a quality or feeling'>spongy</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to her son) Oh, hey, handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!

<i>Chandler</i>I know. He has your eyes.<br>
(Monica looks at him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.<br>
<i>Nurse</i>We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.<br>
(The doctor hands the boy to the nurse, and she walks over to another part of the room with him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.<br>
<i>Erica</i>I'm really happy for you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How do you feel?<br>
<i>Erica</i>I'm tired!<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.<br>
(Chandler stares at the doctor, completely shocked. Monica just freezes and turns around slowly.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm-I'm sorry, who should <b title='↗arrive, show up'>be along</b> and <b title='used for asking what should be done next =now what'>what now</b>?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>The next baby should be along in a <b title='a very short time ↗sec'>minute</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-hu, we only ordered one!<br>
<i>Doctor</i>You know it's <b title='↗triplet'>twins</b>, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people <b title='having more information about sth than most people'>in the know</b>!

<s>The hospital. Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Doctor</i>I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This's never happened before.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>. That makes me feel so special and good.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Yeah, it's here in the <b title='the documents that you need for a particular activity or occasion'>paperwork</b> we got from the <b title='a place where people go to receive a particular type of medical treatment or advice'>clinic</b> in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Ohio_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Ohio_in_United_States.svg/270px-Ohio_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Ohio</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Erica) Did anybody tell you?<br>
<i>Erica</i>I don't think so. Although, they <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good <b title='because'>'cause</b> I'm having a baby.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is unbelievable.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Twins actually <b title='happen'>run</b> in my family.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Interesting! (To Monica) Can I <b title='have a meeting with'>see</b> you for a second?<br>
(They walk over to the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What do we do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do you mean "what do we do"?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='present participle of panic'>panicking</b>) Twins! Twins!!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, you're panicking!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Ok, <b title='what is your opinion'>what do you say</b> we keep one, and then just like have an <b title='the right to buy or sell sth in the future'>option</b> on the other one?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We can't split them up!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why not? We could give each of them half a <b title='a round flat piece of metal that is worn around the neck on a chain as jewelry'>medallion</b>, and then years later, they'll find each other and be <b title='bring two or more people together again after they have been separated for a long time'>reunited</b>. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, <b title='what would happen if'>what if</b> the person who adopts the other one is horrible?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire <b title='all the people who act in a movie etc'>cast</b> of "<b title='an American television comedy-drama [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_is_Enough">Wiki</a>]'>Eight is Enough</b>" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiles) Ok. Shhh...<br>
(He hugs her.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Doctor</i>It looks like we're about ready over here.<br>
(Monica and Chandler run back to Erica's bed.)<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Ow!<br>
(Erica screams.)<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Here she comes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(shocked) She? It's a girl?<br>
<i>Doctor</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!

<i>Ross</i>Nothing! What do you say to that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to emphasize that you will not agree or be able to do sth ↗not really'>No way</b>!<br>

<i>Ross</i>What?<br>

<s>The hospital. Monica and Chandler are holding the twins, while two nurses are taking care of Erica.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Do you think they recognize each other from in there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a <b title="the passage between a woman's outer sexual organs and her uterus ↗vulva, clitoris, cervix, womb">vagina</b> and they meet.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because she's just going to <b title='shoot down - disappoint, ruin the aspiration of'>shoot me down</b>. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's <b title='more sexy'>sexier</b> in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...<br>
(He sits down in the wet paint again.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh, Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Damn it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Ok? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many <b title='sexy ↗cute, gorgeous'>hot</b> guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!<br>
(Mike enters with a roll of paper in his hand.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! What-what do you have there?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..<br>
(He shows them a beautiful banner he has made. It reads, "Welcome to the World, Baby Bing.")<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God! You did that yourself?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Honey, that's <b title='very beautiful and attractive'>gorgeous</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know, the baby can't read, Mike!<br>
(Rachel enters.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here <b title='very soon'>any minute</b>. And-and <b title='↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b>, there's some big surprise.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, didn't she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny <b title='↗mustache, sideburns, goatee'>beard</b>.<br>
(Monica enters carrying her son.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God!<br>
(They all walk over to see the baby.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! Oh my <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>!<br>
(Chandler enters carrying his daughter.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
(Everybody turns around.)<br>
<i>Phoebe, Ross, Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
(They turn back around to see the baby Monica's carrying, but then they realise what the surprise is. Ross, Mike, Phoebe and Rachel <b title='breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasp</b> and stare at Chandler and his baby. Joey hasn't <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figured it out</b> yet.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
(Joey stares at Chandler and Monica and finally <b title='put two and two together - figure sth out from the information available'>puts two and two together</b>. He gasps.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What... What...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes, it's twins!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, they're so cute! <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>Now</b>, what, what kinds are they?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding) that's a girl.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Her name is Erica.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw..<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Aw, he's gonna be so happy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning <b title='used in the names of newspapers'>Gazette</b>. I'm gonna-I'm gonna <b title='make known sth that was meant to be a secret'>blow</b> this story wide open!"<br>
(Chandler and Monica carry Erica and Jack over to the crib and put them down carefully.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.<br>
<i>Mike</i>(To Phoebe) I want one.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try <b title='put sth somewhere quietly or smoothly'>slip</b> it in my coat.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Seriously. You wanna make one of those?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>One? How about <b title='a large number of things or people'>a whole bunch</b>?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the <b title='see The Sound of Music [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music">Wiki</a>]'>Von Trapp family</b>! Only without the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi">Wiki</a>]'>Nazis</b>. Although that sounds <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='boring'>dull</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.<br>
(They hug.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be <b title='in an area near a place or person'>around</b> to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, Aw I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you, all, so much.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I love you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, call us when you get there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I will. Ross, come here.<br>
(She pulls him over to the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Neither will I.<br>
(They hug as Phoebe and Joey stare at the two of them.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Alright, now I really have to go. Ok. <b title='Goodbye (French)'>Au revoir</b>! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.<br>
(She leaves.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, you just let her go?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, maybe that's <b title='used to say sth bad that has happened is not really as bad as it seems because it will make the situation better in the end'>for the best</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b>... You gotta think about last night the way she does, ok? You know maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Chandler) They slept together?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was with you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But now she'll never know how he feels!<br>
<i>Joey</i>But maybe that's ok. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can <b title='change, develop'>move on</b>. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at Phoebe) Right?<br>
(Phoebe nods.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can, you can finally <b title='get over sb - start to forget sb and feel happy again'>get over her</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, that's true. Except, I don't wanna get over her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't! I wanna be with her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I'm gonna <b title='chase, follow'>go after</b> her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, you are!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Woo!<br>
(Monica and Chandler look shocked as Ross goes to leave.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!<br>
<i>Ross</i>My coat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is so <b title='used to show approval'>cool</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross, Ross! What'd you, what'd you think she's gonna say?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, then at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would've happened. Where, where is my coat?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, guys, wish me luck.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hurry!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Good luck, good luck!<br>
(Phoebe and Ross leave.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my god, Ross is going after Rachel. And you guys have babies? This is like the best day ever!<br>

(Ross looks terrified.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Alright, alright, let's do this!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Oh! They're in the table!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, that can't be good!<br>
<i>Joey</i>We gotta get them out of there!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! Oh! Maybe we can <b title='↗tempt, attract, entice, suduce'>lure</b> them out. You know any <b title='birdcall - an imitation of the song or cry of a bird [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdcall">Wiki</a>]'>birdcalls</b>?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Joey, wait! The ball!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh!<br>
(The ball rolls into one of the goals, and Chandler and Joey listen in horror as the ball makes its way inside the table. Finally, they can hear the birds again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh God! So what do we do?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know. Maybe we can <b title='open up means the same as open ↗hang up - hang'>open this up</b> <b title='in some way, by some means ↗somewhat'>somehow</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I wouldn't worry about it. She's always <b title='come up with - invent, think of'>coming up with</b> stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.<br>
<i>Passenger #1</i>But she is sometimes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well...<br>
(The passenger stands up and gets his suitcase from the overhead compartment.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait, what're you doing?<br>
<i>Passenger #1</i>Well, I can't take this plane now.<br>
<i><b title='a female flight attendant =air hostess'>Air stewardess</b></i>Excuse me, sir, where're you going?<br>
<i>Passenger #1</i>I have to get off this plane, ok? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left philange.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Could I get some peanuts?<br>
<i>Passenger #2</i>What's wrong with the plane?<br>
<i>Air stewardess</i>There's nothing wrong with the plane.<br>
<i>Passenger #1</i>Oooh yeah! The left philange!<br>
<i>Air stewardess</i>There is no philange!<br>
<i>Passenger #1</i>Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a philange!<br>
<i>Passenger #2</i>I'm not flying on it!<br>
<i>Air stewardess</i><b title='used as a polite way of addressing a woman'>Ma'am</b>, please sit down!<br>
<i>Passenger #3</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Passenger #1</i>We're all <b title='get off - leave'>getting off</b>. There is no philange!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah well you know, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.<br>
(They do the lame cool guy handshake. They look at each other, and then they hug.)

<i>Rachel</i>(on the answering machine) Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us.

I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you.

<i>Monica</i>Ok, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful. Thank you.<br>
(Two other men are rolling the big white dog out of the apartment.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.<br>
(She <b title='slip - put sth somewhere quietly or smoothly'>slips</b> them some money.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I know. It seems smaller <b title='for some reason that is not clear to you or that you do not understand'>somehow</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Has it always been purple?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of <b title='Rent Regulation in New York State takes the form of rent control and rent stabilization programs.

<i>Phoebe</i>So I guess this is it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. I guess so.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, should we get some coffee?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure. Where?<br>
(They all leave the apartment. Joey helps Chandler with the stroller in the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>, while Monica and Rachel have their arms around each other.

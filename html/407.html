<s>Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey and Chandler are there eating breakfast.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(Entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom saw Kathy naked! It was like <b title='extreme physical pain, esp as a punishment or as a way to make sb say sth'>torture</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know if we <b title='at any time'>ever</b> go to war and you're captured, you<b title='be in for - be going to experience'>'re in for</b> a big surprise.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It just keeps getting worse and worse! You know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommates</b> girlfriend- which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the same room together there's this weird like energy between us. And <b title='describe'>call</b> me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in <b title="boil - a painful infected swelling under sb's skin [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boil'>Wiki</a>] ↗pimple, freckle, mole, tumor, birthmark">boils</b> or something. But there are no boils, she's smooth! Smooth! (Leaves)<br>
(Pause)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! Could everyone totally see up his <b title='bathrobe'>robe</b>?<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah! Oh my God!
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler watches from the <b title='the space where a door opens into a room or building'>doorway</b>.</s>
<i>Casey</i><b title='here you are'>Here you go</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great! All right, so I'll call you later.<br>
<i>Casey</i>Great! (Leaves)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That would be Casey. We're <b title='↗hit on, ask out, date, see, move in, break up, dump, get over'>going out</b> tonight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Going out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So, things didn't <b title='prove effective or successful'>work out</b> with Kathy, huh? <b title='a situation that is disappointing or annoying'>Bummer</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, <b title='exactly'>right</b> after my early dinner with Casey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Shocked) What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is: I just ate a whole pizza myself! (Laughs)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait! You're going out with Kathy!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Why're you getting so upset?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I'm upset- for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very <b title='if you fulfil a hope, wish, or aim, you achieve the thing that you hoped for, wished for etc'>unfulfilling</b> for you. (He can't believe he just sad that.)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>What is the big deal</b>? It's not like we're <b title='available or belonging only to particular people'>exclusive</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean <b title='used when you are admitting that sth is true'>granted</b> I just saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and <b title='get - understand'>gets</b> you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You got all that from the back of her head?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, look, I just think it's time for you to settle down. You know? Make a choice, pick a <b title='one of the several parallel areas on a road which are divided by painted lines to keep traffic apart'>lane</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who's Elaine?
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards, and Phoebe is working on a new song.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Singing) "Little, tiny <b title='the Apeman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan">Wiki</a>] <img src="215px-Tarzan_(1999_film)_-_theatrical_poster-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Tarzan_%281999_film%29_-_theatrical_poster.jpg/215px-Tarzan_%281999_film%29_-_theatrical_poster.jpg">'>Tarzan</b>, swinging on a nose hair.

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well umm, you know, I used to play.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I mean, just a little in high school, but then I really <b title='get into sth - start enjoying sth or become enthusiastic about it'>got into it</b> in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.<br>
(Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and <b title='snort - make a sudden loud noise through your nose'>snorts</b> her drink.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. My God, I completely forgot about your sound.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> hear "The Sound."<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really? No. I mean, no, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal <b title='things'>stuff</b>, you know?<br>

(Monica runs over to Rachel on the couch.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What are you doing? He is <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b> and he's a doctor.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How do you know?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I have plans on Sunday.<br>
<i>Monica</i>With who?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What-what? You are <b title='the person who'>the one who</b> told me how important it is to spend time alone. I can't just go out with that guy when I have plans with myself. Wouldn't be fair to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So basically you're saying you don't want to <b title='secretly have sex with sb other than your husband, wife, or partner ↗run/walk out on'>cheat on</b> yourself?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, if you wanna make me sound crazy.<br>
(Chandler enters)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Saw the new furniture. Very nice.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I kissed Kathy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh God, are you serious?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Does Joey know?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> haven't <b title='screw over - take advantage of'>screwed over</b> a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I think maybe, yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>He loves you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know- I-I said something to Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I remember that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I remember you did.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because you do.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, would it be ok if I wrote a song about this?
<s>A Restaurant called Wicked Pete's Brews. Rachel is <b title='dine - eat dinner'>dining</b> by herself.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(in her head) I don't know if this is <b title='work out - prove effective or successful'>working out</b>. I think...I think I wanna see other people. (Closes her eyes for a second) Wow. Didn't <b title='notice that is likely to happen'>see that one coming</b>. It's not that I don't enjoy this. I do. I just wanna see what else is out there. (The guy that Rachel was talking to earlier in the coffee house walks in. Rachel sees him.) (Out loud) Hey <b title='a name which is of Old German origin, and the meaning is "wood" [<a href="http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Guy">link</a>]'>Guy</b>.<br>
<i>Guy</i>Hey.<br>

<i>Guy</i>I work across the street.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you know what? It <b title='turn out - prove to be, end up, result'>turns out</b> I'm gonna be free Sunday.<br>
<i>Guy</i>Ahh, you know? I wish you had called me. I-I just told <b title='them'>'em</b> I'd work this weekend.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, ok. Well, maybe next weekend.<br>
<i>Guy</i><b title='↗certainly, absolutely'>Definitely</b>! I'll see <b title='you'>ya</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (They both shake hands.)<br>
<i>Guy</i>(in his head) Yeah, you'll be talking to me never, because you're a <b title='sb who looks strange or behaves in a strange way ↗weirdo, creep, psycho, maniac'>freak</b> who eats alone.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! <b title='an Italian anise (a plant with seeds that have a strong taste)-flavored, usu colorless, liqueur (a sweet strong alcoholic drink) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambuca">Wiki</a>]'>Samboucha</b> <b title='a Mexican cocktail [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita">Wiki</a>] ↗Martini'>Margarita</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is that a real thing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, we only had Samboucha, so, it is now.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='What happened'>What's up</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot <b title='in fact, really'>actually</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You do?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, your <b title='the skill/luck of doing sth at exactly the right time'>timing</b> couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, she broke up with me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh uh, when?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kinda scene, that's why I let people watch.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, man, I am so sorry. Are you, are you ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I've been better, you know. But, I'm all right. So you like her, huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, but I-I uh, don't have to.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no, no-no it's uh, it's ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But hey, listen <b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b>, you might <b title='used to say that it will be very difficult to do sth'>have your work cut out for you</b>. Because when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she<b title='be into sb - like sb in a romantic way and are interested in pursuing sth more then a friendship'>'s into</b> some other guy. So...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh. It's me. I'm the other guy.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and <b title='as an explanation of how little things lead to big problems'>one thing led to another</b> and...<br>
<i>Joey</i>And what?! Did you sleep with her?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! No! No! I just kissed her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?!! That's even worse!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How is that worse?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know! But it's the same!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who cares?! You <b title="go behind sb's back - do sth that is kept a secret from sb affected by it">went behind my back</b>? I would never do that to you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally <b title='beyond what is accepted ↗toe the line'>over the line</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God. Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like "Well, kinda.") Well you know what, I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your <b title='a set of electronic equipment with two speakers, used for listening to the CDs etc'>stereo</b>, and there's a <b title='a sweet-smelling brown substance used for giving a special taste to cakes and other sweet foods'>cinnamon</b> <b title='dried grape ↗currant'>raisin</b> <b title='bread in a long, round, or square shape that you cut into slices (thin flat pieces) for eating'>loaf</b> in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Probably because...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Because it's all <b title='taint - spoil sth, esp food or blood ↗tarnish'>tainted</b> with your <b title='act of betraying'>betrayal</b>. <b title='starting from the present time ↗as of, ever since'>From now on</b> this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. (The bread maker <b title='↗go off'>dings</b>) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)
<s>Central Perk, Ross is playing his music. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting on the couch.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God, he's lost <b title='his talent'>it</b>. He's totally lost it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Removing <b title='↗earphone, headset'>earplugs</b>) What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, this's music that cannot get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are <b title='hang - kill with rope ↗suicide, homicide, pesticide'>hanging</b> themselves.<br>
(Ross finally finishes with the same crash, and gets some applause.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. You know, I'm not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my <b title='a series of songs that a band or singer plays or sings in a performance ↗gig'>set</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help. Yeah!<br>
(Phoebe gets up and goes to play, Ross goes over and sits down next to Monica and Rachel.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, like I could lose it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I played bad <b title='↗mean to, intend to'>on purpose</b> guys.<br>
(Both Monica and Rachel laugh.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah-no, just that last song.<br>

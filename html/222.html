<i>Monica</i>Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why not her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Cause she uh, she steals <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Or, maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey that is horrible.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.<br>

<i>Monica</i>So what happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same <b title='a building for public events, esp sports and large rock music concerts ↗arena'>stadium</b>, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce.

<i>Monica</i>Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday <b title='an open pastry or sponge cake containing a sweet or savoury filling [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flan">Wiki</a>]'>flan</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's a traditional Mexican <b title='a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard">Wiki</a>]'>custard</b> dessert.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some <b title='an unpleasantly sticky substance ↗gooey, slush, mud, thaw'>goo</b>.<br>
(Knock at the door)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(answers the door) Dr. Green. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. (Chandler lets go a balloon and it makes noises.) What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>What? The father can't <b title='visit sb, usu without arranging a particular time ↗come by, stop by'>drop by</b> to see the daughter on her birthday?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll <b title='↗relay, pass on'>pass along</b> the message, ok? So bye-bye.<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>Ohhh, you're having a parteee.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>I'll never remember all of that. So uh, <b title="what's going on [<a href='http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080219075548AADF6qE'>link</a>]">what's the deal</b>? Rachel comes home, people <b title='appear suddenly'>pop out</b> and yell stuff, is that it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?<br>
(Knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Green)<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Hi Monica.<br>
(Monica slams the door back shut)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, basically just a Chinese guy.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, hey, Dr. Green, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>Alright, that sounds like a two person job. (They walk into Rachel's bedroom)<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Well, <b title='said when you are surprised or sometimes angry'>my goodness</b>, what was that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>You thought I was Rachel?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes because uh, you look so young.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And because you're both, you know, white women.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>NO! No, I'll take that for ya.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. (Chandler takes the hot pink coat and <b title='grimace - make an ugly expression by twisting your face, for example because you are in pain or do not like sth'>grimaces</b> at it) Ahh, it all looks so nice, so <b title='bright and colorful in a way that makes you think of a celebration'>festive</b>, all the balloons... (Chandler, remembering that Joey and Dr. Green are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a cupboard) Oh, funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...(Joey peeks out)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(cutting Mrs. Green off) Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, you know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're <b title='gal - girl/woman. pal - friend ↗mate, buddy'>gal pals</b>, you know, like at a restaurant Oh, it'll be fun, come on! come on. (They go in the bathroom)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, my God, my God.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, think, what would <b title="characters from Three's Company (an American sitcom) [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three%27s_Company'>Wiki</a>]">Jack and Chrissy</b> do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(peeks back out) Ok, <b title='because of sth/as a result of sth'>now that</b> your coat is safely in the bedr-, (sees that <b title='it is safe to do sth because there is no one to see or catch you'>the coast is clear</b>) oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So uh, Joey and Chandler, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Green over to your place.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uhh, yes, absolutely, um. Why again?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because that's where the party is, you <b title='a silly or stupid person ↗doofus, dummy, dumb, moron'>goon</b>. See this is just the <b title='area or place serving as a point of assembly or preparation on the way to a destination.'>staging area</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right this is staging.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(as they're walking out, Dr. Green questioningly <b title='gesture - make a movement with your hands or head in order to show or tell sb sth'>gestures</b> at the Happy Birthday sign over the door) This is clearly in the wrong apartment. (They all walk across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>)<br>

<s>Later on in the hallway between the apartments. Chandler is showing people to the parties.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Alright you guys are off to party number one (<b title='usher - show sb where they should go; make sb go where you want them to go'>Ushers</b> 3 guys into Monica's apartment) and you, you are off to party number two (Ushers four women into his apartment.

<i>Monica</i>Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? (buzzer <b title="if an alarm goes off, it makes a noise to warn you about sth">goes off</b>) Ok, that's Ross. Alright.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, they're coming, shhh. (Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks for being born.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, thank you for my beautiful earrings, they're perfect. I love you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, now you can <b title='trade'>exchange</b> them if you want, ok.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, we could count again.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God, I can't believe this is happening.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what, this is ridiculous, ok? This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put them all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I do.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's who.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, are you gonna be ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, actually just one birthday flan.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look, talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Joe, Joe. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tongue down my throat. I love this party.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nice! Quick, quick volleyball question.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Volleyball.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Joey, a woman just stuck her tongue down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.<br>
<i>Girl's Voice</i>Dennis.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, that's me. (runs back)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, do you have any ideas for any <b title='used for beginning a statement or discussion'>openers</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's <b title='do - have sex'>doing</b> you daughter' and you should be ok.<br>
[Back in Monica's party]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, (Hands Phoebe a piece of paper) <b title='here you are'>here you go</b>, and write down your most embarrassing memory.

<i>Host</i><b title='people'>Folks</b>, this ever happened to you. You go to the <b title='↗fridge, freezer'>refrigerator</b> to get a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a <b title='↗cartoon, case, pack, crate'>carton</b> of milk) and these <b title='=damn'>darn</b> <b title='a small box made of cardboard or plastic that contains food or a drink'>cartons</b> are so <b title='fucking ↗freaking'>flinging-flanging</b> hard to open.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on TV) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be a better way!<br>
<i>Mike</i>And there is, Kevin!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Can we please turn this off?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title="used to say 'no' in a forceful way ↗not really, nope, nah">No way</b>, Kevin.<br>
<i>Mike</i>...Revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Chandler) Are you <b title='intrigue - interest sb a lot'>intrigued</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're flinging-flanging right I am!<br>
<i>Mike</i>It's the first time, he's never used this product <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>, you're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> see how easy this is to do. (to 'Kevin') <b title='start to do sth, esp after planning it or asking permission to do it'>Go ahead</b>.

This works with any milk carton.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now I can have milk, everyday.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>All right, you've suffered enough. We'll change it. We'll change it. (She does so and there appears another infomercial with Joey in it. This time he is wearing a <b title='↗beard, sideburns, goatee'>moustache</b> trying to sew something.)<br>
<i>Infomercial Announcer</i>How many times has this happened to you? (Joey <b title='↗sting, pierce'>pinches</b> himself).<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (They all stare at her) Ok, it was me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>How is it you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was <b title='as far as or approaching a certain point'>up to</b> 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.

<i>Janice</i>What is the great <b title='a very sad event ↗comedy, disaster, fiasco'>tragedy</b> here? You go get yourself another appointment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, Estelle tried, you know. The <b title='cast - choose which people will act particular parts in a play, film etc'>casting</b> director told her that I missed my chance.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh that is unfair. I'll call her I'll tell her it was <b title='↗completely, entirely, wholly'>totally</b> my fault.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What a sad little life she must <b title='if you lead a particular kind of life, that is what your life is like'>lead</b>. Ok, ooh (Starts dialing).<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the <b title='a piece of cloth tied around your neck to support an injured arm or hand ↗cast, gauze, bandage, Band-Aid, plaster'>sling</b>.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Is anybody else <b title='↗frightened, terrified, alarmed'>scared</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(on phone) Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>that's it</b><b title='↗fire, lay off, quit'> for Estelle</b>. I don't care! Annie you are a <b title='a very nice person'>doll</b>, what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen, a pen.

<i>Phoebe</i>(looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting <b title='things'>stuff</b> in boxes!<br>
(They all run and join her at the window.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'd say from the looks of it, our naked buddy is moving.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗sarcastic, metaphorical, simile'>Ironically</b>, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!<br>
<i>All</i>Oh Yes! Great idea!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It would be so cool to live across from you guys!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how-how great it is!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's-there's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(trying to <b title="take sb's attention from sth by making them think about or notice other things ↗distraction">divert</b> his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI! Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! What?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing! Oh God, now we're just so excited that you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> get this apartment!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)<br>

<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey you guys!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey! Come here! Come here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (<b title='↗stare, gaze, glimpse, glance'>Glares</b> at Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. You know, Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey <b title='gasp - take a short quick breath through the mouth'>gasps</b>) Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yes, but, you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know, that we can just tell them we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-what do you mean?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well you know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them <b title='a (large) number of'>a bunch of</b> laundry to do.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh no-no-no! No, wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That doesn't sound like fun.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So we'll make it fun, we'll do it like a- like a <b title='quartet - a group of four musicians or singers [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_quartet">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-BarbershopQuartet_Disneyworld-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/BarbershopQuartet_Disneyworld.jpg/220px-BarbershopQuartet_Disneyworld.jpg">'>barbershop quartet</b>.

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Noo! I-I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I got your secrets. I got their secrets. I got secrets of my own you know!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(To Phoebe) So, umm, how-how are we gonna <b title='deceive sb or cause trouble for them'>mess with</b> them?<br>

<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.<br>
(She gets up and goes over to Chandler who's ordering some coffee from Gunther.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if you really wanna know, I- Oh! I can't tell you this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well actually you're the one person I can't, tell this to. And the one person I want to the most.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I think it's just you know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and, you know how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's <b title='exactly'>right</b> there in front of you <b title='↗swig, gulp, gobble, down'>sipping</b> coffee- Oh no, have I said too much? Well, it's just something to think about. I know I will.<br>
(She makes a show of bending over to get her coat and showing off her bum. She then walks out, leaving no one to eat her cookie.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok, now you're even cuter!<br>

<i>Monica</i>What're you talking about?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b> I think Phoebe thinks I'm <b title='sexy'>foxy</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's not possible!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ow!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry it's just, I mean Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you know I-I can't hear that enough.<br>

<i>Monica</i>This bicep?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well it's not <b title='flex - tighten your muscles'>flexed</b> <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>! Why is it so hard for you to believe that Phoebe could be attracted to me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's not. All the girls are attracted to you. You're part bunny.

<i>Phoebe</i>(laughs) <b title='used when you want sb to stop doing sth or stop speaking'>Please</b>.<br>
(She <b title='saunter - walk in a slow and relaxed way ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_walk">catwalk</a>]'>saunters</b> over to Chandler with a <b title='not kind'>mean</b> pair of 'Come <b title='here'>hither</b>' eyes and she glares at Monica.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So Chandler, I-I'd love to <b title='visit a place for a short time ↗come over, stop by'>come by</b> tonight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(initially worried, but <b title='get over - begin to feel better after an upsetting experience'>gets over</b> it) Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh absolutely. Shall we say, <b title='↗sharp, precisely'>around</b> seven?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having <b title='the act of having sex ↗consummate, holy matrimony'>sexual intercourse</b>.<br>
(As she walks away, Chandler <b title='mouth - move your lips in the same way you do when you are saying words, but without making any sound'>mouths</b> a scream to Monica. She <b title='motion - make a signal to sb ↗gesture'>motions</b> and mouths, "It's ok, it's ok.")<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend!<br>
(They all run over to the window.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah!
<s>Ugly Naked Guy's apartment. Ross is naked (no body parts are showing that shouldn't be seen on a national TV show), along with Ugly Naked Guy, eating a muffin and drinking a cup of tea.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Would you like another mini muffin? Try the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Blueberries-In-Pack-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Blueberries-In-Pack.jpg/220px-Blueberries-In-Pack.jpg">'>blueberry</b>, they're delicious.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Phoebe ready for her date.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Show time!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, Rachel, get me <b title='↗wear, cologne'>perfume</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! (She runs to get some.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He <b title='begrudge - allow or give unwillingly ↗reluctant'>begrudgingly</b> does so.)<br>
(In the meantime, Rachel has returned with the perfume and sprays a <b title='↗fog, moisture, vapor, droplet'>mist</b> out in front of Phoebe who walks through the mist and does a little spin. Phoebe walks over to Joey who walks out of the kitchen with 2 coffee cups and what seems to be a bottle of wine)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. Thanks. But umm, glasses that do not have handles and that are glass. And umm wine that is not olive oil.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh! (Walks into the kitchen)<br>
(Joey reads the bottle he originally got and starts to laugh)<br>
[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Monica is getting Chandler ready for his half of the plan.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Relax, she-she's gonna give in <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> before you do!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How do you know?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>At this?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Just go <b title='engage in sexual activity'>get some</b>! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)<br>
[Cut to the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>, Phoebe is outside getting some last minute instructions from Rachel.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(handing her the wine) Ok honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good idea!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh now, don't <b title='bet everything you own'>give away the farm</b>!<br>
(Phoebe knocks on the door with the wine and Chandler answers it. Rachel hides next to the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Come on in.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I was going to. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure.<br>
(She makes a big show out of pulling out the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_%28material%29">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-IAPH_Saca_del_corcho-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/IAPH_Saca_del_corcho.jpg/220px-IAPH_Saca_del_corcho.jpg"> ↗cap, lid'>cork</b> and pours the wine.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, here we are. Nervous?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Me? No. You?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I want this to happen.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So do I.<br>
(They click their glasses and take a sip. That sip turns into a <b title='↗sip, swig, down'>gulp</b>, which quickly progresses into their mutual draining of their glasses <b title='at the same time'>at once</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm gonna <b title='=switch/turn on'>put on</b> some music. (He does and <b title='without realizing what kind of situation you are involved in'>unknowingly</b> it's some <b title='haunt - return repeatedly to the mind of sb ↗spooky'>haunting</b> music in which Phoebe and Rachel, who is listening outside the apartment, are confused) Joey likes to scare the duck. (He puts on some romantic music.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather <b title='making you think of sex ↗seductive, provocative'>suggestive</b> and <b title='sexually attractive'>seductive</b> dance that's silly at the same time.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You look good.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thanks! You know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeveless_sweater">Wiki</a>]'>sweater vest</b> <b title='immediately'>right</b> off!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, do you not wanna?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No. No! I just, you know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.<br>
[Cut to the bathroom, Chandler is entering.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Ok? She wants me to put lotion on her!<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's <b title='bluff - pretend sth, esp in order to achieve what you want in a difficult or dangerous situation'>bluffing</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, she's not <b title='back down - admit that you are wrong or that you have lost an argument'>backing down</b>! She went like this! (He does a little <b title='↗ape, copy, do, imitate, impersonate, mock, mime, simulate'>mimic</b> of her dance.)<br>
[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is <b title='confer - discuss sth with other people ↗conference'>conferring</b> with Rachel.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's Chandler, you-you can <b title='defeat easily'>take</b> him. I mean come on, don't you remember, when you made him cry using only your words?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh! I like that!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Phoebe) Oh, ok! Show him your bra! He's afraid of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere">Wiki</a>] ↗lingerie, panties, knickers'>bras</b>! Can't <b title='manipulate; unfasten '>work</b> <b title='them'>'em</b>! (He <b title='done quickly and immediately'>swiftly</b> rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's not my first time.<br>
[Cut to the bathroom.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>You go back out there and you <b title='persuade sb to have sex with you'>seduce</b> her till she <b title='crack - fail, give way'>cracks</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course.<br>
[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you're-you're going?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have <b title='used for emphasis'>all</b> the sex.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You should be. I'm very <b title='easy to bend ↗flexible, elastic'>bendy</b>. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not if I kiss you first.<br>
(They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her right hip. Phoebe then grabs his butt. Chandler <b title='go for - choose, try to get'>goes for</b> her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh-eh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Here it comes. Our first kiss.<br>
(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is <b title='squint - partly close your eyes'>squinting</b>. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! Ok! Ok! All right! You win! You win! I can't have sex with ya!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And why not?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because I'm in love with Monica!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're-you're what?!<br>
(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a <b title='bolt of lightning ↗<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_%282008_film%29"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Bolt_ver2.jpg/220px-Bolt_ver2.jpg"></a>'>bolt</b>, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Love her! That's right, I... LOVE... HER! I love her! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just - I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used as an interjection'>Dude</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And <b title='used to say you admire sb very much because of what they have done ↗bravo, applause'>hats off to</b> Phoebe. Quite a <b title='↗contestant'>competitor</b>. (Pause) And may I say your breasts are still showing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>God! (She turns and buttons up.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! So <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>that's it</b>! It's over! Everybody knows!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well actually, Ross doesn't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him <b title='used in negative sentences to say that sb should not or need not do sth now'>yet</b>.<br>
(Joey suddenly gets very angry.)
<s>Ross's new apartment, he is showing his boss, Dr. Ledbetter his new place and new <b title='your general attitude to life and the world'>outlook</b> on life.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Well here it is. A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's you know, <b title='furnish - put furniture and other things into a house or room ↗decorate'>furnished</b>.<br>
<i>Dr. Ledbetter</i>I must say it's nice to see you're <b title='be successful again after having problems ↗get over'>back on your feet</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I am that. An-and that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.<br>
<i>Dr. Ledbetter</i>I wonder if it's time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I- What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh... What're you doing?! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!<br>

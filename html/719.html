<i>Joey</i>I'm sorry, do I know you?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Uh. Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait <b title='=till, until'>'til</b> it's over. Chandler and I have this <b title='a formal agreement ↗deal'>pact</b> not to have sex again until the wedding.<br>
<i>Ross</i>A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> <b title='prepare'>make up</b> the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us for a few days.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I don't know! I mean, it's not like it's <b title='pornography - books, videos etc making people feel sexually excited ↗erotic, obscene, dirty'>porn</b>! This is a serious, <b title='being in accordance with established or accepted patterns and standards'>legitimate</b> movie. You know? And the nudity is really important to the story.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's what you say about porn.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the <b title='a request to a performer who has auditioned for a role etc to return for another audition'>callback</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! No you should! A lot of major actors do <b title='naked'>nude</b> scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b> it sounds really great.

<i>Rachel</i>She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well that's just two days away. What is the other option?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yesterday!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>My God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Uh, so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i>Actually, I tried to call you. You didn't need to come down here today.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, great! You know I would've been perfect for this <b title='character/role'>part</b>, but whatever! You know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! <b title='used to say hello or goodbye, esp in the morning or afternoon'>Good day</b>! (Starts to leave.)<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i>Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down, because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And <b title='↗cut'>scene</b>! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little <b title='improvisation - acting or singing in which sb invents the words or music as they speak'>improv</b> there. Yeah! Ok! So you-you-you-you were saying?<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i>Well the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow! Sure! That's great!<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i>Oh and your agent said you are ok with the nudity.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah sure, just <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i><b title='excellent; wonderful'>Terrific</b>! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is <b title='real, accurate, based in fact'>authentic</b>. Yeah. And so, in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So... (Laughs.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>So... What?<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i>So, uh, well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, uh, <b title='anatomical - relating to the structure of human or animal bodies'>anatomically</b> not Jewish. You know what I'm saying?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes!<br>
<i>The Casting Director</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. What?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Wow! Wow! And it's <b title='↗absolutely, certainly'>definitely</b> all gone? There's nothing there to work with? (Joey <b title='↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glares</b> at her.) What were you thinking?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know! I really want this part! You know? And they tell you no matter what you get asked during an audition, you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell <b title='them'>'em</b> you can! And you just <b title='be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figure out</b> how to do it later.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to... grow a turtleneck!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, my God, what are you gonna do?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I just have to call my agent, and tell her I can't do the part. Aw! (Gets up for the phone.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Unless!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Unless what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, this may sound crazy, but, there maybe something that we could <b title='shape or make sth, using your hands or only a few tools'>fashion</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well I'm not sure yet, but umm <b title='used when giving quick and approximate answers to questions, to indicate that a response is not necessarily accurate'>off the top of my head</b> I'm thinking, double sided tape and some sort of <b title='finely chopped cooked meat that has been pressed together in a container, usu sold in cans and served cold in slices. luncheon - formal lunch [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luncheon_meat">Wiki</a>]'>luncheon meat</b>.

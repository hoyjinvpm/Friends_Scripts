<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a <b title='↗confer (discuss), convention'>conference</b> in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados">Wiki</a>]'>Barbados</b>, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Mmh-mmh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Barbados!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to-to hear me give my speech! Oh! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to <b title='pull strings - secretly use your influence with important people in order to get what you want or to help sb else'>pull some strings</b> but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) These babies will get you into all the <b title='the study of fossils'>paleontology</b> lectures and <b title='a meeting where a group of people discuss a problem or topic ↗semester'>seminars</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, Ross, I mean, we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='want to'>wanna</b> do, you know, "island's <b title='things'>stuff</b>".<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, right, because he's a scientist!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, no, oh, because, you know, he's been in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk">Wiki</a>]'>Minsk</b> for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, we gotta go, yeah? Uh, so, we'll see you guys tomorrow.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a blanket Joe, not a <b title='↗cape, Harry Potter, Frodo'>cloak of invisibility</b>!

<i>Charlie</i>Wow! This place is beautiful!<br>

<i>Woman</i>Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>!<br>
<i>Woman</i>Doctor Geller, I am such a huge fan!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That... never happens.<br>
<i>Woman</i>I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your <b title='relating to the most important part of a formal meeting, report etc'>keynote</b> speech.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! This is very <b title="If sb's remarks are flattering, they praise you and say nice things about you">flattering</b>, uh...<br>

<i>Ross</i>"Sarah. I <b title='like ↗excavate'>dig</b> you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".<br>

<i>Sarah</i>(to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, God, no! No! No no, Uh, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to address sb ↗man, pal, buddy, fella'>Dude</b>, it's, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! That was a- yeah. No no, I uh, I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at?<br>
<i>Sarah</i>Well it was a pleasure to meet you all.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You too, Sarah. Bye.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to show mild surprise =jeez ↗Jesus, gee, jee'>Geez</b>, who doesn't own a TV?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Actually, I don't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, and mine broke two months ago, I still haven't <b title='↗get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> a new one.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, didn't you two come to the right convention.

<i>Monica</i>David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.<br>
<i>David</i>Oh, certainly. That's a combination of <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/VenturiFlow.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle">Wiki</a>]'>Bernoulli's principle</b>, and <b title='when one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of the first body [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_third_law_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law">Wiki</a>]'>Newton's third law of motion</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Chandler) See?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='=all right'>Alright</b>, I'm gonna go <b title='get'>pick up</b> a few things for the trip.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I should go, too. Ok, oh, <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>now</b>... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.<br>
(Everyone looks at her)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mike?! Who's Mike?<br>
<i>David</i>Mike is your-your ex... uh... boyfriend!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's right! Oh, yeah. Well, I've totally forgotten about him! AH! That's-that's-that's... <b title='sth from the past that you remember, see, or hear again, and that reminds you of that time in your life'>a blast from the past</b>!<br>
<i>David</i>It's ok. Ho-<b title='sth not done deliberately'>honest mistake</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(upset) She does?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title="squeeze sb's skin between your thumb and finger">pinching</b> her) Let's get you out of here! (they go outside)<br>
(Outside the Central Perk)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, at uh least you took me down with you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sooo sorry! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-why do I miss Mike? That's just, that's gonna go away, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess, in time.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean, my-my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
<s>Inside Central Perk.</s>
<i>David</i>(to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh I wouldn't read too much into it.<br>
<i>David</i>Still you know, a-a girl calls you by her ex-boyfriend's name, that-that-that's not a good thing, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>David, let me, let me stop you there <b title='because'>'cause</b> I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza <b title='sth such as cream or cheese that you put on top of food to make it look nicer or taste better'>toppings</b> or <b title='[<a href="http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/burning-when-i-pee">Is this bad? </a>]'>burning sensation when you pee</b>.<br>
<i>David</i>Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Seriously, we're gonna do this?<br>
<i>David</i>I'm sorry, I, I just wish I could make her forget about Mike <b title='used as an intensifier to express exasperation or impatience'>already</b>, you know... Why-why did Phoebe and Mike uh break up?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Huh! I'm sorry, that's the <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> thing I do. (pause) They-they broke up because Mike didn't wanna get married. Hey, <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?<br>
<i>David</i>That's great! That's, that's great! I'll-I'll <b title='↗engagement'>propose</b> to her!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>David</i>Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no, I didn't mean now.<br>
<i>David</i>Why-why not? It's <b title='extremely clever'>brilliant</b>! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll-we'll see you at the wedding, <b title='man'>fella</b>! (pause) well, we-we probably won't invite you to the wedding but... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. I sincerely, thank you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.<br>
<i>David</i>(after a while) How do you think I should propose?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>David, I'm pretending to read here!

(Trying on a hat and talking to his own reflection in the mirror)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! How you doing? Yeah alright!<br>
(Charlie comes out the bathroom)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a <b title='a piece of underwear or the bottom half of a bikini that has a single string instead of the back part'>thong</b>, where's the thong?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>(laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant <b title='open shoes which are held on your foot by a V-shaped strap that goes between your big toe and the toe next to it =flip-flops ↗slipper'>thongs</b>...<br>
<i>Joey</i>You really should've been more clear about that!<br>
(Someone knocks the door, Joey goes to open it and Ross is on the other side)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Excited) You're never gonna guess who I just saw downstairs!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh oh ah ah! <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears">Wiki</a>]'>Britney Spears</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, she never misses these conferences. (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Did you talk to him?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah... what am I gonna say to Kenneth Schwartz?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You could say: "Hey Kenny, <b title='why'>how come</b> you're not Britney Spears?" (looks at Ross <b title='not showing feelings or emotion'>matter-of-factly</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Charlie) You ready to go?<br>
(Charlie nods)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? You-you're gonna go now? I thought we could <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hang out</b>.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Oh I can't. I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I'd look at his speech.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Will you wear a thong?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>I will if you will.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You got yourself a very weird <b title='agreement'>deal</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(a little embarassed by their conversation) <b title="I'm ok / No thanks / I'm fine, I don't need it. [<a href='http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091027113011AAnRBrW'>link</a>]">I'm good</b>, I-I have dinner plans (moves away from them).<br>
<i>Charlie</i>So you're gonna ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah. I got, I got <b title='lots'>tons of</b> stuff I could do. I'm gonna <b title='arrive somewhere'>hit</b> the beach, go swimming...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, why?<br>
(Ross goes to the window and opens the curtains revealing that it's raining outside)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>There's an indoor pool, you-you could swim there!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (<b title='remove - take sth away from, out of, or off the place where it is ↗replace'>removes</b> a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his <b title='↗rucksack, knapsack, sack'>backpack</b>)

<i>Monica</i>Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't-I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling <b title='slightly rude or showing a lack of respect, but often in a funny way'>cheekily</b>) I do! <b title='want a'>Wanna</b> <b title='↗tip, heads-up'>hint</b>? huh? "I do" (Monica looks <b title='↗puzzled, perplexed, bemused, bewildered'>confused</b>, so Chandler repeats) "I do".<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I'm sensing this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled <b title='delight'>glee</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>David is gonna propose to Phoebe.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? (looks very shocked) Why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now, could-couldn't you've made some sort of inappropriate joke?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I did! A penis one! <b title='just let me know'>Just so I know</b>, what was so wrong about what I said?<br>
<i>Monica</i>They've only been going out for a few weeks! Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> Phoebe will end up alone again.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Man, that's some bad advice!

<i>Joey</i>Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!<br>

<i>David</i>So, um... I am uh, proposing to Phoebe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (<b title='squint - look at sth with your eyes partly closed'>squints</b> at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Oh, hey, don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! You know, an-and Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Um, well I-I know we start by discussing the <b title='faults/weaknesses ↗disadvantage, failing, drawback'>shortcomings</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dating">Wiki</a>]'>carbon dating</b>. Um, and then, then I move on to what is <b title='↗apparently, evidently, obviously'>clearly</b> the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of <b title='a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, , forming approximately 300 million years ago [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangea">Wiki</a>]'>Pangea</b>, hello!

<i>Joey</i>Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).

<i>Mike</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, Mike, enough is enough, <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">now</b>, you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to <b title='recover from'>get over</b> your whole "I never wanna get married" thing and <b title='come forward'>step up</b>!<br>
<i>Mike</i>Who is this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Sure, Monica. So good to have you back in my life.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Listen, Phoebe is back with David, and he's gonna propose to her, and she is gonna say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!<br>
<i>Mike</i>(sounds shocked and sits down) He's... he's gonna propose?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I-I'm sorry, did you say something? I-I, I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, <b title='without success in spite of your efforts ↗vein, to no/little avail'>in vain</b>)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna <b title='prevent sth from happening'>stand in the way of that</b>, neither should you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've <b title='get sb (on the phone)'>got</b> you, you've got <b title='≠straight'>curly</b> hair. What do you do in the humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damn it!<br>
(Chandler walks in)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you <b title='deliberately try to influence or change a situation that does not concern you =interfere ↗intervene'>meddle</b> in people's lives!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe is gonna say "yes"? That's, that's great!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No it's not, bcause she's still in love with Mike!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And there's not chance that will work?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, then I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - <b title='at the beginning'>in the first place</b>!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Very well. In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and <b title='stroke - move your hand gently over sth ↗caress, feel up, grope'>stroking</b> it)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. (they walk away to a snack table)<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, Kate, how's the... uh pharmacy game treating you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Frank, I tell you, it's <b title='difficult ↗tough, tricky'>rough</b>. I mean, is it me or is doctors' handwriting getting harder and harder to read?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) I'm an actress.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Oh... So, what's the movie about?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, well, I play the handsome, <b title='↗masculine, feminie, girlie, sissy'>macho</b> pharmacist, right? And Rachel, is my student, who-who wants to learn all about... pharmacing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, and, see, see, I'm, I'm shy at first, but then, I take off my glasses and I become sexy, you know. And it's-it's, and there's some nudity, but it's very <b title='↗cheesy, tacky, classy'>tastefully</b> done.<br>

<i>Charlie</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God, we-we did it! (he sits beside her and <b title='skim - read sth quickly =scan ↗flip'>skims</b> through her notes excitedly)<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, but I-I did make a <b title='↗pharaoh, sphinx'>pyramid</b> out of the bath products. This-this is, ah, this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's-that's a pretty necklace.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey uh, <b title='used to make a suggestion'>what'd you say</b> we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh my God, I love you.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Ok, odd thing to get excited about!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! High-five! (they high-five)<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My <b title='↗fiancée - the woman whom a man is going to marry'>fiancé</b> was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.<br>

<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry, we uh... we can't.<br>

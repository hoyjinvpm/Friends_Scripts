<i>Monica</i>(Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I just told my mom I'd <b title='provide food and drinks at an event'>cater</b> a party for her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='why'>How come</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little <b title='a very small amount'>smidgeon</b> of self-respect.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> just in there by myself.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Let-let me ask you a question.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why did you hire me?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh, well Richard <b title='rave - talk about sb you enjoy or admire in an excited way ↗brag, boast, smug, gloat'>raved</b> about the food at his party, <b title='of course'>'course</b> you were sleeping with him.

So, at least that would be something. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I didn't hear that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could <b title='behave in an unfair way to sb, such as by blaming them or criticizing them unfairly'>pick on</b> me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.<br>

<i>The Salesman</i>(Entering before Joey can say anything) Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhhhh.<br>
<i>The Salesman</i>Do you ah, currently own a set of <b title='a book or set of books giving information about a lot of different subjects or one particular subject [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-EncycBrit1913-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/EncycBrit1913.jpg/220px-EncycBrit1913.jpg">'>encyclopedias</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No. But ah, try the <b title='classified ads ↗commercial, infomercial'>classifieds</b>, people sell everything in there.<br>
<i>The Salesman</i>Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?<br>
(We go into a <b title='a scene in a film, play, book etc that shows sth that happened before that point in the story'>flashback</b> sequence with Joey remembering some of those times.)<br>

<i>All</i>Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)<br>
[Cut to Monica and Rachel's, they're all there playing cards.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to <b title='feel that you are not accepted or welcome in a situation'>be left out</b>.)<br>
{The Algonquin Round Table was a regular dinner meeting at which many of New York City's greatest literary minds of the 1920's presided. They met at the Algonquin Hotel in New York City, which was named for the indigenous tribe of the area (The Algonquins were a tribe of Native Americans).<br>The "kid's table" reference is to the Thanksgiving holiday. Often at Thanksgiving, the extended family members attend (or serveral outside families) at only one house. At mealtime, there aren't enough seats at the formal dining table, so the kids are seated at folding card tables, TV trays, etc. Being seated there is sort of a social caste - you aren't "adult" enough to sit at the "grown-ups'" table.

<i>Joey</i>Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in. Come on.
<s>The Geller's Kitchen, Monica and Phoebe are still cooking.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's weird.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your nails.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my mom wouldn't give me <b title='trouble or problems'>grief</b> about me biting them.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. No, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them when I put... (Realizes) Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, don't panic. I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it's <b title='because'>'cause</b> they're gonna eat - that's the problem.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(Entering) (to Monica) Honey, don't bite your nails.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok ah, please don't <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak out</b>. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in-in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(Laughs) I'm not freaking out.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Um, why are you laughing?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>It's nothing, it's just that now your father owes me five dollars.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? You <b title='↗gamble, stake'>bet</b> I'd lose a nail?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these. (Opens the freezer to reveal...)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Frozen <b title='lasagna/lasagne - a type of Italian food made with flat pieces of pasta, meat, or vegetables, and cheese [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagna">Wiki</a>] ↗spaghetti, macaroni, ravioli, pasta, pastry'>lasagnas</b>?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Um-hmm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You bet that I'd <b title='make a bad mistake or do sth very stupid'>screw up</b>?! It's all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>No, that was all true. This was just in case you <b title='Inspired by the television show Friends, "pulling a Monica" refers to any and all screw-ups by an individual.

<i>Monica</i>You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humor, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.<br>
<i>Joanna</i>No, we are. I'm sad.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
(They start kissing again, but are interrupted by the phone.)<br>
<i>Joanna</i>(Answering the phone) Yes. (Listens) Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? (Listens) All right. (Hangs up) Aw, unbelievable! Aww.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Joanna</i>No, no, that-that was my boss. I have to go.<br>

<i>Joanna</i>Just a little <b title="A gift given at a gift exchange, usu around Christmas time that is given strictly for comedic effect, or to piss off/annoy the receiver, or both. ↗<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdsm'>BDSM</a>.">gag gift</b> somebody gave me.

<i>Joanna</i>(Kisses him) I'll be back in ten minutes. (Starts to leave)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You are, you're gonna leave me like this?<br>
<i>Joanna</i>Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kind of exciting, don't you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. But if you don't come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, swear, you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. You wanna see the list?<br>

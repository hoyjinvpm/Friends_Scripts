<i>Monica</i>Chandler, what were you thinking?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Ok, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down... (He falls asleep.)<br>

<s>Central Perk, Ross and Phoebe are there.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, ok-and <b title='for your information - used when you are telling sb that they are wrong about a particular fact/used esp in short business notes and emails, when you are telling sb sth they need to know'>F.Y.I</b> she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I <b title="to not give a rat's ass - to not care at all">don't give a tiny rat's ass</b>."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You think he's emotionally unavailable?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I think he can be.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, maybe he wouldn't be, if she didn't bring the office home with her every night!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(angrily) I knew you were gonna <b title="throw sth in sb's face - say unkind things about sb's behavior in the past during an argument">throw that in my face</b>! That was three years ago! She apologized and apologized! What more do you want?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!<br>

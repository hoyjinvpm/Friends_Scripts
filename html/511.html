<s>Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are hosting a New Year's party. So the place is crowded and in a shameless promotion for NBC - they're watching <b title='an American stand-up comedian and television host [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Leno">Wiki</a>]'>Jay Leno</b>'s <b title='when a subject or event is reported on TV or radio, or in newspapers'>coverage</b> of New Year's from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Square">Wiki</a>]'>Time Square</b>.</s>
<i>Jay Leno</i>(On TV to <b title='a personality (sb who is very famous and often appears in the newspapers, on TV etc, esp an entertainer or sports person) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Clark">Wiki</a>]'>Dick Clark</b>) Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! <b title='used when you are starting to do sth or when sth is starting to happen'>Here we go</b>! 1999! The year of Joey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='without any expression or emotion'>deadpan</b>, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's the matter?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to, so, you know...<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, I'll <b title='deal with'>take care</b> of it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh no, wait! Joey! It's 36 seconds till midnight. What're you <b title='going to'>gonna</b> do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Will you just trust me?<br>
(They try to stop him, not sure of what he's planning. He ignores them and goes to talk to Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗skip, jump'>hopping</b>) 33! 32! 31!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well who's gonna kiss my sister.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Awww, <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>! Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>-dude, who would you rather <b title='have sb do sth'>have kiss</b> your sister, me or Chandler?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a good <b title='a single fact, idea, or opinion that is part of an argument or discussion'>point</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, great!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pheebs! Pheebs! Listen, Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross, you got the history.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So?<br>
<i>Joey</i>So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, good point.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>All</i>(watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!<br>
(And with that everyone starts playing <b title='The act of French kissing. tonsil - the two small round pieces of flesh at the sides of your throat'>tonsil hockey</b>. Chandler with Monica, Ross with Phoebe, and Joey with Rachel.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Happy New Year!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Happy New Year.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You too!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So did that <b title='have any effect to'>do anything for</b> <b title='you'>ya</b>?<br>
(Rachel slowly walks away.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, after the party. Everyone has left, except for the <b title='a group of people'>gang</b>.</s>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? I'm gonna <b title='take a risk'>go out on a limb</b>, and say no <b title='↗alimony'>divorces</b> in '99!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But your divorce isn't even final yet.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Just the one divorce in '99! You know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='so you can masturbate'>Do you want us to leave the room</b>, or?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Everyday I am gonna do one thing I haven't done before. That, my friends, is my New Year's resolution.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's a good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is to find a <b title='↗boatload, payload, truckload, mouthful, handful, spoonful'>planeload</b> of people who's resolution is to <b title='fall suddenly and quickly from a very high place =plunge ↗dive, swoop'>plummet</b> to their deaths.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe your resolution should be not to <b title='↗laugh at, mock, condescend, patronize'>make fun of</b> your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She has a better chance of <b title='sprout - start to grow'>sprouting</b> wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>In fact, I'll bet you 50 <b title='dollars'>bucks</b> that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, you know what, <b title='used when you are adding a new idea that you think is better than a good one already mentioned ↗still, yet another, yet again'>better yet</b>? A week.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks can be the (does the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes">Air quotes</a>]'>quote-marks</b> thing) "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him and gestures for him to give him money.) And it starts <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, my New Year's resolution, is to learn how to play guitar.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?! <b title='Why'>How come</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, you know those special skills I have listed on my résumé? I would love it if one of those was true.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh really? Who-who have you taught?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I taught me and I loved me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah that'd be great! Yeah, thanks Pheebs!<br>
<i>Monica</i>My resolution is to be less <b title='too interested in or worried about sth'>obsessed</b> with being neat and clean.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? Hmm. (grabs some <b title='cracker - a hard dry type of bread/a thin flat crisp biscuit'>crackers</b> and <b title='crumble - cause sth to break into small pieces ↗crumb, crumple'>crumbles</b> them into little pieces and drops them on the floor.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Noooooooo!<br>
(Rachel, proud of herself that she <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked out</b> Monica, finishes dusting the crumbs off of her hands)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(calming down) Or something else.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna really be needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, from what I hear, needs to keep his <b title='staple - have strong sexual intercourse with a female'>stapler</b> in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, <b title="talk about other people's behavior and private lives ↗rumor, scandal, [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_girl'>Gossip Girl</a>]">gossip</b> less.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh- I don't gossip!<br>
(They all laugh.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I <b title='pass sth on - give sb a piece of information that sb else has given to you'>pass that information on</b>, you know, kind of like a public service. It doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call <b title='a British American broadcast journalist [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Koppel">Wiki</a>]'>Ted Kopel</b> a gossip?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well if Ted Kopel talked about his <b title='↗colleague, workmate'>coworkers</b> <b title='badly done'>botched</b> <b title="a medical operation to change the size of a woman's breasts, esp to make them bigger">boob jobs</b>, yeah I would.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-wh? They were like this! (She puts her hands over her breasts and indicates that the coworkers boob job resulted in one pointing up and one pointing down with her hands by pointing up with one hand and down with the other.) All right. Ok. Fine, fine. My new year's resolution will be not to gossip! It's easy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh easy, you have never kept a resolution.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(a little shocked) Yes I have!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Laughs) Ok, let's see how you did last year...(starts walking quickly towards Rachel's room)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Starts to quickly chase after Monica) No-no. Not my diary. No-you cannot read my diary. (Unfortunately for Rachel, Monica has successfully <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> Rachel's diary from her room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(reading Rachel's diary) <b title="The words at the beginning of a diary entry written by sb who can't think of anything to write or thinks their diary is alive.">Dear Diary</b>, I am so excited. My resolution is to write in you every day. I'll see you tomorrow. (<b title='spread objects or parts out, often in the shape of a semi-circle'>Fans</b> the pages of Rachel's diary) Nothing!<br>
(Rachel quickly grabs back her diary and closes it)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know... not a lot happened last year. (sits down) All right-all right I'll prove to you that I can keep it this time. No more gossiping!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I hate gossip. In <b title='typically includes seventh, eighth and ninth grades. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_high#United_States">Wiki</a>]'>junior high</b> <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> girl said a lot of <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> <b title='things'>stuff</b> about me and I <b title='↗light, ignite'>set her bike on fire</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, what did she say about you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She said I was crazy. Well I guess she <b title='get - receive sth as a punishment'>got</b> hers huh. (does a little evil laugh)
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Ross is talking to a beautiful woman as Chandler and Joey enter.</s>
<i>Woman</i>I'll see you tomorrow.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler and Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just <b title='↗flirt, hit on, pick-up line, go out, date'>asked that girl out</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nice!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nice! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(reading it) Elizabeth <b title='↗deceive, cheat, bamboozle, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornswoggle">Wiki</a>]'>Hornswoggle</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗horny (sexually excited), swoggle - mix of suck, swallow and gargle (wash the throat with liquid kept moving about by a stream of breath) [<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swoggle">link</a>]'>Horn-swoggle</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You ok Chandler? Is there something, something <b title="To sum up, it's no good family name.">funny</b> about that name?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No. No, I just think that maybe I've-I've heard it somewhere <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>. (Sits down rubbing his <b title='one of the two fairly flat areas on each side of your forehead'>temple</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh really? Where? Somewhere funny <b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I'll bet</b>! (Chandler is <b title='strain - try very hard'>straining</b> to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi, Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's ear.) Hornswoggle.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗not at all, no, nope, nah'>Not really</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I haven't told you her middle name yet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, don't, just don't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, see you later.<br>
<i>Joey</i>See <b title='you'>ya</b>! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! No-no, first you learn here, (Points to her hand.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Umm, ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, lesson one: <b title='a guitar chord is a set of notes that is played on a guitar. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_chord">Wiki</a>]'>chords</b>. Now, um, I don't know the actual names of the chords, umm, but, I-I-I <b title='make up - invent'>made up</b> names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Holding up her hand and then <b title='configure - arrange'>reconfiguring</b> her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Ok, umm, Turkey Leg, and Old Lady. (Joey tries to <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, impersonate, mime, mimic, mock, simulate'>imitate</b> them.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. You know some might <b title='think/feel'>find</b> it amusing, I <b title="used to emphasize 'I' or 'me'">myself</b> find it regular.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with Rachel.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I didn't! Even when I found out... umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Pheebs! Check-<b title='look at this'>check this out</b>. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, you-you <b title='if you nail sth, you succeed in getting it, after a lot of time or effort / nail - fuck'>nailed</b> the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I <b title='stop by - make a short visit to'>stopped by</b> this guitar store and...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Did you, did you, touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. <b title='give me'>Gimme</b> it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) <b title='a small, flat object that you use for pulling at the strings of a musical instrument such as a guitar'>Pick</b>. Do you want to learn to play guitar?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Then don't touch one!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering, with Ben) Hi!<br>
<i>Ben</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi, Ben!<br>
<i>Ben</i>Auntie Monica! (He runs to hug her.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone <b title='express an opinion =remark'>comment</b> on the pants!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I think they're very nice.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I really like them a lot.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I like them a lot.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not, what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't <b title='usually'>generally</b> wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's <b title='↗arse, ass, bottom, butt, posterior, rear, stern, tush, tushie, tushy'>buttock</b>.) Maybe there's something in that area.<br>
(They all speak at once in general approval of his pants selection; Joey asks where he got them. I can't <b title='recognize'>pick out</b> the rest of it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store I go <b title='past'>by</b> that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) you know, I never owned a really good smelling pair of pants before."<br>
(No one says anything.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>! (Storms out.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(after he's left) Ok, seriously, what do you think?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You look like a <b title='sb who is considered to be very strange =weirdo'>freak</b>. Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)<br>
(Monica starts taking pictures of Ross and Ben, with the flash.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What- Hey- What're you doing, what're you doing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's my New Year's resolution!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Tto blind my child?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone can enjoy the pictures.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to <b title='hold or put the body in a certain way'>strike a pose</b> with the <b title='much more than is reasonable or necessary'>excessive</b> amount of pictures that Monica takes.)

<s>Elizabeth Hornswoggle's apartment; Ross is there on his date with her. They are sitting on the couch watching a movie. Ross is <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> hot.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She <b title='If you snuggle somewhere, you settle yourself into a warm, comfortable position, esp by moving closer to another person ↗cuddle, huddle, embrace, hug'>snuggles</b> closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?<br>
<i>Elizabeth Hornswoggle</i>No.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, it must just be me then.<br>
(He shifts on the couch and a ripping sound <b title='emanate from - come from'>emanates from</b> his lower regions, the sound reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. In other words, it sounds like he <b title='fart - release gas from the bowels through the bottom =break wind'>farted</b>. She has a look of <b title='very bad and shocking =horrifying'>horrific</b> <b title='a feeling or expression of admiration or surprise'>wonderment</b>, wondering "Did he just fart?")<br>
<i>Ross</i>That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh, go ahead.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> into her bathroom.)<br>
[Cut to Elizabeth Hornswoggle's bathroom, Ross frantically pulls his shirt out and <b title='drop - let sth fall'>drops</b> his pants. He <b title='exhale - send air out of your lungs ↗inhale, gasp, ventilate'>exhales</b> in <b title='used for emphasis'>sheer</b> <b title='a feeling of extreme happiness ↗orgasm, erotic'>ecstasy</b> as the coolness of the bathroom <b title='envelop - cover or surround sth completely ↗encircle'>envelops</b> his legs.

He next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he wants it to. So he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. He jumps up and hops to the sink. He turns on the water and starts to splash some on his legs, cooling them further.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh........<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>(yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is <b title='going to happen soon'>coming up</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok!<br>
(He goes to pull up his pants, but can't seem to get them past his knees. He frantically tries to pull them up <b title='without getting the effect you wanted or intended'>to no avail</b>. Panic <b title='set in - make sth start happening'>sets in</b>.)<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yes! Yes, I did.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! I-I didn't touch a guitar!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, but you're questioning my method!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, I'm not questioning it Phoebe, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera <b title='click - make a short hard sound'>clicks</b>, taking another picture.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. (Leaves.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, none of my other student, thought I was stupid.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Your other student, was you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, well, you know maybe you just need to try a little harder!<br>

(Rachel looks shocked, <b title='get over - begin to feel better after an upsetting experience'>gets over</b> it, notices she's alone, and picks up the phone. The last part of which is something she shouldn't have done, because the phone is already in use. By Monica, and now Rachel can hear every word.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) I can't wait to be with you!

Then put them back on, go out there and tell her you're the incredible <b title='a fictional character, a superhero that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_(comics)">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Hulk_movie-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Hulk_movie.jpg/220px-Hulk_movie.jpg">'>Hulk</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler's not there...huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well that would've worked but all right, fine. Umm, you see any- uh- oh! <b title='a thick oily substance used on dry skin [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaseline"Wiki</a>]>'>Vaseline</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh, I-I see <b title='a thick liquid that you put on your skin in order to clean it or make it feel softer and less dry ↗potion, cream, moisturizer'>lotion</b>, I have lotion! Will that work?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, sure, throw some of that on there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hold on.<br>
(Ross proceeds to <b title='apply - spread liquid'>apply</b> <b title='in large amounts; more than enough ↗abundant, plentiful'>copious</b> amounts of the lotion on his legs. He <b title='used to emphasize what you are saying'>literally</b> starts spraying the back of his legs with the lotion, and as he applies some to his butt he makes a happy face like he enjoyed that <b title='a feeling that you get from one of your five senses, esp the sense of touch'>sensation</b>. After using about half the bottle he again tries to pull up his pants, but at the first sign of resistance, his hand slips off of the pants and hits him in the forehead.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sounds like it's working.<br>
(Ross goes back to his cell phone.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?! Uhh, what color is it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What difference does that make?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I'm just - if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Joey, do you have a minute?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Dude, what am I gonna...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it <b title='work out - solve a problem'>works out</b>. (He hangs up the phone and <b title='stranded - left in difficulties; strand - cause sth to be left on the shore and unable to return to the sea'>strands</b> Ross in the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh well, your timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Ok. Ok. Joey, I have got to tell you something!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What-what is it, what is it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me you cannot tell anyone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> know!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! Yes! Yes, you <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> wanna know! This is unbelievable!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets and can't tell anyone!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?<br>
<i>Joey</i>And you're not supposed to be gossiping!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone... (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm not listening to you!<br>
(Chandler seeing that Joey has his eyes closed sneaks over and picks up the chicken. The chicken starts flapping it's wings in protest as Chandler holds the chicken inches from Joey's face. Joey stops yelling and upon opening his eyes sees the chicken, <b title='↗screech, shriek, squeal, squeak'>screams</b>, and falls to the ground in horror.)
<s>Elizabeth's apartment; Elizabeth is <b title='↗query, enquire'>inquiring</b> <b title='concerning'>as to</b> the delay in Ross's exit from her bathroom.</s>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kind of <b title='very anxious, upset or afraid ↗flipped out'>freaked out</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>No, let's just leave the lights on.<br>
(Ross opens the door and steps into the living room. He has fully removed his pants and holds them wrapped into a ball in front of his <b title='the area between your legs where they join your body ↗groin'>crotch</b>. His legs are covered in the powder and lotion paste. He looks terrible.)<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I had a <b title='↗issue, trouble'>problem</b>.
<s>Central Perk, Joey is there to apologize to Phoebe.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I can't talk to you! I don't have a <b title='fashionable and expensive'>fancy</b> ad in the Yellow Pages!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, um, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again? And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a <b title='a musical sound'>note</b>. However, while <b title='strum - move your fingers across the strings of a guitar or similar instrument'>strumming</b> it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sitting back down) Was the chord at least right before it went down...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No!
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his horrible <b title='a long and difficult journey'>trek</b> back home without pants on. The whole gang is there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>This year was supposed to be great! Oh it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!<br>
<i>All</i>No, you're not a loser.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look at me! (Chandler <b title='squeak - make a short high noise or cry that is not loud'>squeaks</b> in an attempt not to make fun of him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, be-because of the leather pants?<br>
<i>Monica</i>See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! I mean that's something.<br>
(All at once.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It really is something; that's a very cool thing.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='hello (used in Western, particularly the Southwest (such as Texas and Tennessee) and rural)'>Howdy</b> partner! Hey-hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, you know, they-they had some with the, with-with <b title='a decorative edge of hanging threads'>fringe</b> all down the sides.<br>
(Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs, you may know this, you know strange things- what is the boiling point of brain?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I used to know this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would <b title='have the qualities that are necessary for'>make</b> a good cowboy. (He <b title='strut - walk in a proud way trying to look important'>struts</b> into Monica's room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, <b title='because of sth, as a result of sth'>now that</b> everything's <b title='wrap sth up - finish sth'>wrapped up</b> here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, me too. You know if the shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.<br>
(They both exit.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I <b title='think ↗reckon'>figure</b> if I hang around there long enough, someone's <b title='very likely to'>bound to</b> leave one of those planes <b title='with its owner not present'>unattended</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Good luck, honey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, uh, Joey?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Umm?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out <b title="without anyone's help">on your own</b>, that would be ok and then we could talk about it. Right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be ok. Yeah. Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would you mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he uh borrowed from me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Now? You-you want me to go over there now? I don't-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Do you know something?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Do you know something?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I might know something.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I might know something too.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's the thing you know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't tell you what I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well then I can't tell you what I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, fine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Fine.<br>
(Silence <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You don't know!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (<b title='honor and glory'>Kudos</b> to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that <b title='words that sb has to learn and say as part of a play or performance'>line</b>.

<i>Joey</i>(gasps) YOU KNOW!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>AND YOU KNOW!!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I know!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler and Monica?! Oh, this is unbelievable! How long have you known?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Too long! Oh, my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Oh listen, listen, we can't say anything to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen... (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)<br>
<i>Joey and Rachel</i>Yeah... Hey... Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! It's raining. I don't like to fly in the <b title="↗it's raining cats and dogs, it is pouring down, it's pouring with rain">rain</b>. So...<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I am gonna <b title='leave the place where you are, in order to do sth'>go for</b> a walk in the rain. Ha ha.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohhh, yeah, me too.<br>
(They both exit.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're <b title='having sex'>doing it</b>.

<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Oh good, ok, look, I can't <b title='↗accept, bear, stand, help'>take</b> it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, ok? Here! (Hands Ross the 50 bucks he's <b title='if sb is about to do sth, they will do it very soon'>about to</b> owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet?

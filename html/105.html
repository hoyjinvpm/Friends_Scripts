<i>Ross</i>Not that big a deal? It's amazing.

All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>Come on</b>! You guys can <b title='pass liquid waste from your body =urinate'>pee</b> standing up.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We can? Ok, I'm trying that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, you know what <b title="blow sb's mind - overwhelm/excite sb ↗mind-blowing">blows my mind</b>? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is <b title='be too difficult for me to understand'>beyond me</b>.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh, right, right, shut up.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone except for <b title="Apparently he was her ex-boyfriend.">Kevin Millmore</b>, may he <b title='rot in hell/jail - suffer or be punished for a long time'>rot in hell</b>. You just <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> do it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note. You try to, you know, run out of the restaurant before she's actually finished the note.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If-if you want, I'll do it with you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're <b title='gang up on - join together in a group to hurt, frighten, or fight sb'>ganging up on</b> her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Tony?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know, he's <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his <b title='a refusal to eat in order to make a protest'>hunger strike</b>, or, I don't know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, <b title='tasting like or containing nuts ↗-y'>nutty</b>, <b title='tasting like, or containing, chocolate'>chocolaty</b> kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel <b title='give sb a dirty look - look at sb in a very disapproving way'>gives him a dirty look</b>) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so <b title='scrunch - make your face or part of your face into a tight shape in order to show an emotion. e.g. "She was red with anger and her face was all scrunched up."'>scrunchy</b>?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Did he give you that whole "You're-not-<b title='up to - able to do or deal with'>up-to</b>-this" thing again?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three <b title='chorus - the part of a song that does not change and is repeated several times'>choruses</b> of "You'll never <b title='be successful at sth such as in your job'>make it</b> <b title="alone, without anyone's help">on your own</b>".<br>

(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)<br>
<i>Angela</i>Hi, Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>My God, Angela.<br>
(Angela takes a seat at the counter.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, being <b title='dump - end a romantic relationship ↗break up'>dumped</b> by you obviously <b title='agree with - suit'>agrees with</b> her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you <b title='going to'>gonna</b> go over there?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> seem too eager. <b title='To count seconds. It takes one second to say Mississippi.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, big <b title='a style of attractiveness that suggests wealth'>glamour</b> night. Me and Monica at <b title='A self-service laundry ↗Laundromat'>Launderama</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a <b title='strange or unusual and a bit frightening =weird'>freaky</b> coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Don't you have a laundry room in your building?<br>

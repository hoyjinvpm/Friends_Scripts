<i>Phoebe</i>You guys, why didn't you tell me you were <b title='if two people elope, they go away secretly to get married'>eloping</b>?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i><b title='because'>'Cause</b> it just sort of happened. You know, we at the <b title='a building that has one or more courts in it for legal trials ↗city hall, municipal'>courthouse</b>, we having lunch...<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Ok.<br>
<i>Frank Jr..</i>Oh, and also, uh, we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station. (Phoebe is not even paying attention.) Well, actually, we kinda need an answer to that one <b title='at the present time/immediately ↗by now, right away'>right now</b>.

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, what's your <b title='idea/opinion'>point</b>? (Goes to sit on the couch)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, the <b title='things'>stuff</b> I just mentioned.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, I don't know if I could <b title='at any time'>ever</b> do that.

<i>Joey</i>Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh Chandler, that is so nice.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, that is really nice......lying!! <b title='used to tell sb that sth is impossible'>No way</b> is that the reason.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, he's right, I'm <b title='completely ↗pretty much'>totally</b> lying.<br>
(Ross gives Rachel a <b title='showing too much satisfaction with your own cleverness or success'>smug</b>, "I told you so" look.

(Monica and Rachel have been trying not to laugh during this exchange.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean that he's great in bed.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot. Loudly and a lot! All night long she'd agree!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great <b title='because'>'cause</b> you guys are in love.<br>

(The same kid is about to say something but Joey warns him not to say anything by pointing at him. Joey looks to his right and sees Ross, in a large glass display, working with his back to the group.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (He knocks on the glass and Ross turns around.) Everyone wave hi to Ross. (All the kids wave) Ross is one of our most important scientists. Look at him hard at work.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Waves back and takes something (a piece of chalk?) from his hand and pretends to make it disappear in his ear. He then makes it appear from his mouth.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (They both sit on the couch)<br>
<i>Phoebe Sr.</i>(Sighs) Uh, I really don't think it's a very good idea Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Phoebe Sr.</i>Well, because, you'd be giving up a baby. And, I, I really don't, I don't know if there's anything I could say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby, so, um...

<i>Phoebe Sr.</i>No no no, the-the puppy is yours. (Hands her the puppy)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I get a puppy?<br>
<i>Phoebe Sr.</i>Well yeah. I mean yeah, but, for only three days.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why? (The puppy starts <b title='wriggle - move or make sth move by twisting or turning quickly ↗squirm, twist'>wriggling</b> in her arms and she plays with him)<br>

Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Puts the puppy in her lap and tries not to play with it.)<br>
<i>Phoebe Sr.</i>I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies.

Aw, I really shouldn't 've given you the puppy first.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sorry. That's ok. No we're listening.<br>
<i>Phoebe Sr.</i>I just think that, it would be something that you would regret <b title='used to emphasize that you are talking about every person or thing'>every single</b> day for the rest of your life. (Reaches over to pet the puppy) So, however hard it is, for you to give up this puppy, it would be like a <b title='↗zillion, jillion, trillion'>million</b> times harder to give up a child.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, <b title="used to say that you agree with sb's suggestion or that sth seems reasonable =ok">fair enough</b>. Three days.<br>

<i>Monica</i>(to Chandler) So, did you do it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='unhappy, disappointed, or sad ↗depressed'>dejectedly</b>) Yes, yes, we had the sex.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-oh, it was bad?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "Uh, I see your <b title='idea/opinion'>point</b>.

<i>Chandler</i>Look, you have to help me, ok? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. You know I know where everything <b title='go - be placed'>goes</b>. It's always...nice. But I need to know what makes it go from "nice" to "My God, somebody's killing her in there!"<br>

<i>Joey</i>Morning, <b title='↗roommate, classmate, playmate, teammate'>roomie</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="third time's the charm - the third time you try to do sth, it will work.">Fifth day's a charm</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?<br>
(Ross enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you're not naked! So, hey, Raych, when-when will we expect to see you tonight?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I'll probably be back to <b title='pick up - go and meet sb/sth, and take them somewhere (usu in a car)'>pick her up</b> <b title='↗about'>around</b> six, but she's in the bedroom <b title='completely'>all</b> ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...<br>
<i>Joey</i>She's probably <b title='↗worn out'>exhausted</b> from all that <b title='very attractive ↗delightful, lovable'>adorable</b> screaming she did last night.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye!<br>
(She leaves.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Bye! Hey, I-I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, hey, it's been great.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, ok? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally <b title='walk in on sb - go into a room and see what sb is doing, when they did not want to be seen'>walk in on</b> a woman using a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Avent_isis_breast_pump.jpg/180px-Avent_isis_breast_pump.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_pump">Wiki</a>]'>breast pump</b>...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, that'll do it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow! So, how are you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm, I'm ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure, I mean, you know, do I wish me and Rachel living together would've <b title='work out - prove to be successful'>worked out</b>? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like uh, it's a divorce.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, actually it...<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, <b title='deal with, make progress with'>get on with</b> our lives, maybe, maybe start <b title='↗date, go out'>seeing</b> other people.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow, really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure, I know lots of girls.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? Any names come to mind?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, names?
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey. I was just <b title='going to'>gonna</b> get something to eat. You want something?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What you got?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(checks the <b title='freezer, fridge'>refrigerator</b>) Ok, let's see, we got <b title='strain - separate solid things from a liquid by pouring the mixture through sth with very small holes in it ↗sieve, colander'>strained</b> peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Red-Plums.jpg/300px-Red-Plums.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum">Wiki</a>]'>plums</b>. We haven't tried that yet.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='a word used by children to express pleasure or excitement ↗goody, baddie'>Goodie</b>! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to <b title='fix up - arrange ↗set up'>fix him up</b> with somebody.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her, too.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why are they doing this?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just wish they'd realize they should be together.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I <b title='thought'>figured</b> you know, that's where things <b title='be heading/headed - if you are heading for a particular situation, it seems likely to happen'>were headed</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. Hey, I may not have kids; someone's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> <b title='continue'>carry on</b> the <b title='=surname, last name ↗first name, given name'>family name</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know what? Maybe once they start <b title='date - have a romantic meeting with sb'>dating</b>, and they see what's out there, they'll realize how good they are for each other.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, because it is <b title='a small amount left after others have taken a share'>slim pickings</b>. You know? I had this date last night: <b title='an expression of disgust ↗eww'>Yuck</b>! But we should probably keep <b title='voice'>it</b> down; she's still in the bedroom.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna <b title='start to do sth, esp after planning it'>go ahead</b> and <b title='set up - arrange for two people to meet'>set them up</b> with people?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah... Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realize how good they are together.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, that's a great plan!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> do my "plan-laugh." (A <b title='behaving as if you are crazy'>maniacal</b> laugh follows.)<br>
(They both start laughing really loudly.)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='↗shush'>Shhh</b>! Not so loud, we don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> wake her up, uh...<br>
(He looks at his bedroom door, but he can't remember the name of the girl.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're in the kitchen as Rachel enters.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See, now, why would you <b title='↗pressume, suppose'>assume</b> that? Just because we're married? I mean I will have you know that we are very <b title='hip and happening - fashionable and up to date'>hip, happening</b> people. Now, <b title='used to tell sb politely that you are leaving'>if you'll excuse me</b>, I have to get back to reading the <b title='obituary - a published notice of a death'>obituaries</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I was just asking <b title='because'>'cause</b> I need someone to watch Emma tonight.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure, we'll do that. What are you <b title='occupied with'>up to</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Phoebe set me up on a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why? What's the big deal?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all <b title='fixed'>set</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. <b title='hug'>Embrace</b> your womanhood!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You want a job? Turn off "<b title='an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah">Wiki</a>]'>Oprah</b>," and send out a <b title="/'rezjumei/ ↗CV (curriculum vitae)">résumé</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So I'll bring her <b title='in order to visit a person or place for a short time ↗come by, drop by'>by</b> around seven? Is that ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, it's perfect.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. <b title='because of sth, as the result of sth'>Now that</b> she's eating solid food, she <b title='poop - pass solid waste from the bowels =poo ↗feces, dropping'>poops</b> <b title='all day and all night'>around the clock</b>. And <b title='=look out'>watch out</b> for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she <b title="also a movie's name [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Murder'>Wiki</a>]">screams bloody murder</b>, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(reading the newspaper) Suddenly I, wish I was reading my own name.
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>. Joey is drinking coffee by the counter as Phoebe enters.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! Who is he?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it's <b title='used to mention sb/sth without giving a name'>this</b> guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean <b title='make sb/sth stay on sth, and stop them from moving away or escaping'>hold down</b> so he wouldn't turn over and <b title="show one's sexual organs">flash</b> me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(gives a thumbs up sign) Ok, ok. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah.<br>
(They sit down on the couch.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, she's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>A teacher?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah, she's really <b title='be into sth - like sth'>into</b> history and foreign movies... Oh, oh, and she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, Ross does. What... You're-you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've-you've <b title='fix up = set up'>fixed him up</b> with his perfect woman!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God, you're right!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>She even reads for pleasure!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How do you even know a woman like that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What-what? I'm not allowed to know smart women?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I met her at the library. I went in to <b title='=urniate'>pee</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So now what do we do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, ok, I'll-I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>What if</b> we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's <b title='canceled ↗put off'>off</b>, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh... Oh I hear that's bad.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, so this is great! Oh, Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realize how good they have it together.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, yes, the Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...(Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")<br>
(They both start laughing again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I think we <b title='kill it - over-do'>killed it</b>.
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment.

<i>Chandler</i>Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.<br>
(He does the ancient trick of going downstairs while behind the couch. As soon as he's out of sight, Emma starts crying.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's ok, it's ok. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a <b title='a joke from a comedy routine'>bit</b>! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!<br>
(Monica enters from their bedroom with a calendar.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, <b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b>, I'm gonna be <b title='↗egg, ovary, womb, uterus'>ovulating</b> from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't <b title='↗masturbate'>touch</b> yourself in the next 48 hours.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't do that.<br>
(Monica looks at him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Today is the sixth.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, it's not.<br>
(Points at the calendar.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, it's also 2003.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's ok. Go take the test, see if we're ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
(She runs to the bathroom, while Chandler starts acting like a chicken in front of Emma. Emma is silent, however.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='tough guy - men with closed tear ducts. duct - a narrow tube in your body or in a plant that liquid passes through. crib - a bed for a baby or young child'>Tough crib</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I might've checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
<s>Delmonico's restaurant. Ross is waiting for his <b title='an arranged meeting between a man and woman who have not met each other before'>blind date</b> to <b title='arrive at the place where sb is waiting for you'>show up</b>.</s>
(Ross shakes a piece of butter out of his fork and hit a man at a nearby table.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sorry. Hey, would you, you want a <b title='a small round loaf of bread'>roll</b> with that or?<br>
(A waiter walks past him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='a polite way of attracting the attention'>Excuse me</b>, um, I'm sorry, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Um, someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Can I get you another glass of wine?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='no'>Nah</b>, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Got stood up, huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Are you worried your <b title='sb who you have a date (romantic meeting) with'>date</b> came, saw you, and left?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
(The waiter leaves.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica emerges from the bathroom.</s>
<i>Monica</i>We're ok. I'm still ovulating.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, good, because <b title='indicating the time or date from which sth starts ↗ever since, from now on'>as of</b> four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, let's do this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I-I don't think I can.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because of Emma.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Unless... Maybe we <b title='have sex'>do it</b> here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... <b title='{old-fashioned} if two people canoodle, they kiss and hold each other in a sexual way ↗make out'>canoodling</b> in it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Canoodling?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I can't say "<b title='have sex'>hump</b>" or "<b title='fuck'>screw</b>" in front of the B-A-B-Y.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Horrifying? <b title='if an unpleasant experience scars you, it leaves you with a feeling that continues for a long time'>Scarring</b>? Something people go to jail for?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess you're right.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?

<i>Steve</i>I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "Well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That <b title='am/are/is/have/has not'>ain't</b> gonna happen.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, come on, Steve; let's not <b title='make it impossible for sth to happen'>rule out</b> nervous laughter. So now, I-I think that we should order, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> eat, and then leave.<br>
<i>Steve</i>I have a lot of medical problems.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, now, wait a minute. Phoebe told me that-that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok, ok, I'm sure that Rachel came home early, and picked up Emma. You go look across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>, and I'll call her <b title='=cellphone'>cell</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (Runs out.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because <b title='in some way that is not known yet ↗somehow, somewhat'>one way or another</b>, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
<s>The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Steve are walking home from their date. Steve is <b title='sob - cry noisily while breathing in short sudden bursts ↗whine, weep'>sobbing</b>.</s>
<i>Steve</i>(sobbing) I-I can't believe I?m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Really?<br>
(He puts his hand on her shoulder.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Don't touch my coat!<br>
(Her cell phone rings.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Hey, Rach, how's it <b title='go - happen'>going</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, this is the worst date ever!<br>
(Steve starts crying loudly.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Steve) Oh <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? (To Monica.) <b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, did you <b title='visit ↗come by, drop by'>stop by</b> here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, then...<br>
(Joey and Chandler enter with Emma.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, thank God! Emma, there you are!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? What-what do you mean, "there you are?" Where was she?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, we were playing "<b title='In the game, the older player hides their face, pops back into the baby&#039;s view, and says Peekaboo! [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekaboo">Wiki</a>]'>peek-a-boo</b>." She just, she loves it when I'm <b title='↗exaggerate'>dramatic</b>.<br>
(Monica hangs up, and Rachel looks at her phone.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Joey) Why the hell did you take her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Because you two were (in a quiet voice) having sex!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, we weren't!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't you lie to me! I can <b title='recognize, notice'>tell</b> by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_positions">Sex positions</a>]'>Can't you get on top for once</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Which is more than I can say for myself as of 2 o'clock today.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Guys... guys! Seriously, those sticks are expensive!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, it was unacceptable that you would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm have to tell Rachel about this.<br>
(Joey starts to leave.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b>! Unless...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Unless what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? Why?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Your family name is Tribbiani.<br>
<i>Joey</i>...(Laughs.) You almost <b title='sb has been had - used to say that sb has been deceived'>had me</b>.<br>
(He leaves.)
<s>The street in front of Central Perk. Steve and Rachel are still there.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, uh...<br>
<i>Steve</i>Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really, really not.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Eh, it's <b title='If you say that sth that has happened is just as well, you mean that it is fortunate that it happened in the way it did.'>just as well</b>. Doesn't work anyway.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.<br>
(She walks over to Central Perk and enters to find Ross sitting on the couch, eating crab cakes. She takes off her coat while groaning and <b title='shudder - shake with fear, horror, or disgust ↗shiver, tremble, quake'>shuddering</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what's wrong?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just had a <b title='difficult'>rough</b> night.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. Crab cake?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Eww!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, what-what happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but-<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica told me you had a blind date.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I did, too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>But is it <b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>technically</b> a date if the other person doesn't show up?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why does everyone keep saying that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That bad?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, he makes T-shirts <b title='↗live on/off'>for a living</b>, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me, this.<br>
(She holds up a black t-shirt with "FBI - Female Body Inspector" on the front.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Female body inspector? What size is that?<br>
[Cut to outside. Phoebe and Joey are walking down the street to Central Perk.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Now wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How-how do I get them to name the-the next one after me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, it's easy, you just, you just <b title='go into a room and accidentally interrupt sb who is doing sth private that they would not want you to see'>walk in on</b> them having sex.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.<br>
(Phoebe sees Rachel and Ross through the window.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.<br>
(Joey does the "plan-laugh.")<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.<br>
[Cut to inside Central Perk.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute; you don't think it was <b title='↗accidental, deliberate, on purpose'>intentional</b>? I mean, that's just stupid.<br>
[Cut to outside Central Perk.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>We're <b title='↗genius, genus, genuine, genie'>geniuses</b>! Yeah, look at <b title='them'>'em</b>, look at 'em, they're really <b title='a process in which a special relationship develops between two or more people'>bonding</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah, they're falling in love <b title='starting again from the beginning'>all over again</b>.<br>
(Rachel and Ross turn around and look at Phoebe and Joey with puzzled expressions on their faces.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Where?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mexico!<br>
(They run down the street with Ross and Rachel following right behind them.)
<s>Delmonico's restaurant. Ross and Joey are sitting at a table for four. The waiter is pouring water in their glasses.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Can you believe they're still not here?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the <b title='↗probability, likelihood, odds'>chances</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know, I'm so <b title='sad, very unhappy. also "bummed out"'>bummed</b>. Can we have our free crab cakes now?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>We've been stood up. (<b title='sniffle - sniff slightly or repeatedly, usu because of crying or having a cold ↗sniff'>sniffles</b>) And we want our free crab cakes.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>You were stood up here last night.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know. It hurts. (Joey pats Ross on his back) Being stood up two night <b title='one after another without a break ↗in tow'>in a row</b> has left a crab cake sized hole in my heart.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Guys, <b title='said when you want sb stop talking about or doing sth that is annoying you'>give it a rest</b>. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> have a pool going, to see how long it takes that guy to cry.<br>
(He points at Steve who's sitting at another table. He's staring at his hands.)<br>
<i>Steve</i>I have such fat hands! I hate my <b title='penis'>dick</b>!<br>

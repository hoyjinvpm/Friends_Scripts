<i>Monica</i>Hey guys!<br>
<i>All</i>Hi! Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We need to talk to you about something.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.<br>
<i>All</i>What? Hey! What're you talking about? Are you kidding?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's just with um, work and the <b title='pressure'>stress</b> of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. <b title='used to add more information ↗besides'>Plus</b>, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='having doubts'>skeptical</b>) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no! We made this decision together.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She's <b title="put words in sb's mouth - tell what sb should say">putting words in your mouth</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, it's not!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a <b title='time for rest'>break</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you, Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure. It's <b title='only'>just</b> <b title='too, also'>as well</b>... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's <b title="lose one's touch - lose one's ability to handle sb/sth">losing her touch</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? You are <b title='completely wrong'>way off</b>, lady!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll-you'll be trying to <b title='be better or more impressive'>top</b> than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's my favourite kind! Ok, we're doing this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't let yourself get <b title='manipulate - influence sb or control sth in a clever or dishonest way'>manipulated</b> this way!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We're supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch <b title='a talk show [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Phil_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>The Doctor Phil</b> I <b title='tape - record using tape'>taped</b> for you?
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Monica are in there, and Phoebe enters.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah, happy <b title='unnecessary'>needless</b>-turkey-murder day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You guys, I ordered uh some chocolate pies from that <b title='a building where bread, cakes, etc. are made or sold'>bakery</b> on <b title='Bleecker Street [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleecker_Street">Wiki</a>]'>Bleecker</b>. Could you <b title='pick up - get'>pick them up</b> for me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're not making the pies yourself?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No no no no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I entered this pie-eating <b title='↗rival, competition, match, game'>contest</b>. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me <b title='↗vomit, throw up, puke, retch, gag'>sick</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Did you <b title='used to emphasize that sth is good in a bad situation'>at least</b> win the contest?<br>
<i>Monica</i>2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one <b title='small metal container in which food or drink is sold =can'>tin</b>! Ok, I'll see you guys at 4.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Can't wait!<br>
<i>Monica</i>This dinner is <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be so great! <b title='an exclamation of contempt (a feeling that sb/sth is not important and deserves no respect)'>In your face</b>, last year "me"!<br>
(Monica leaves)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Rach.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's Emma doing today?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, let's see, uh, I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> she has to make a very big <b title='solid waste that comes out of your body ↗pee, feces, dung, dropping, manure'>poop</b>. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> enter her in a baby beauty <b title='a competition between young women in which judges decide who is the most beautiful ↗<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Congeniality_%28film%29">Miss Congeniality</a>'>pageant</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! That's the <b title='creepy - strange or unnatural and making you feel frightened'>creepiest</b> thing I've ever heard!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real <b title='"sth that is of very poor quality"'>dog</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastic</b>) Yeah o-ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, just the idea of <b title="pit against - test sb's strength, ability, power etc in a competition">pitting one baby against</b> another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a <b title='a prize, for example a silver cup'>trophy</b>-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And a thousand dollars.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>is something I'm <b title='↗intrigued'>very interested</b> in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mock, mimic, simulate'>mocking</b> Ross) what's in the inside is important.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, oh, and Emma needs a <b title='↗cowboy'>cowgirl</b> <b title='a set of clothes that are worn together'>outfit</b> for the competition.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I was thinking-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, take the clothes off Joey's <b title='a line of dolls [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage_Patch_Kid">Wiki</a>]'>Cabbage Patch Kid</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is watching TV and Monica is cooking.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the <b title='a stick that a conductor (the leader of a group of musicians) use'>baton</b> again?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why come all the way from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas">Wiki</a>]'>Kansas</b> to do that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what just <b title='if a thought or idea occurs to you, you suddenly and unexpectedly start to think about it ↗come up with, hit'>occurs to</b> me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You don't know that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Somebody is gonna <b title='choose'>pick</b> us.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it's been weeks!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favorite <b title='Ernest Miller Hemingway [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemingway">Wiki</a>]'>author</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Name one of his books.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(after a long pause) "<b title='a 1991 legal thriller [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firm_%28novel%29">Wiki</a>]'>The Firm</b>"?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, let's see. Uh, <b title='ok'>k</b>, the turkey is in the oven, the <b title='a mixture of bread or rice, onion etc that you put inside a chicken etc before cooking it'>stuffing</b> is ready-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, Chandler, that's <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "<b title='attracting much attention and publicity'>high profile</b>".<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, let's see. Oh, the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Cranberries20101210.jpg/220px-Cranberries20101210.jpg">'>cranberry</b> sauce, it is easy to make and no one really cares about it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Tell me more.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I'm gonna go check on something across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap! (she leaves)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You obviously haven't tasted my <b title='Palmolive brand soap [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive">Wiki</a>]'>Palmolive</b> potatoes!<br>
(Ross and Joey enter)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Three tickets to today's <b title='a professional ice hockey team based in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers">Wiki</a>]'>Rangers</b> game!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to address sb ↗man, buddy, pal, fella'>Dude</b>, I wanted him to guess.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, they're great seats too!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Guess where they are?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Center ice.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Did I do something to you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hmm, the game's at one.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna <b title='manage to arrive on time'>make it</b> back.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to <b title="call sb's name in a public place ↗PA (public address system)">page</b> us to go <b title='pick up - go and meet'>pick him up</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dude, two times that happened!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, Monica's been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing <b title='from the beginning'>in the first place</b>, we shouldn't go!<br>
<i>Ross</i>He's right, man.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I guess. <b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, so see you at four.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... <b title='chanDler + berry'>chanberries</b>!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>But we can't leave now!

This competition just <b title='blow wide open - make it impossible to guess who will win a competition'>blew wide open</b>, <b title='people'>folks</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one-year-old running around with <b title="a very thin piece of women's clothing that covers their legs from the toes to the waist">pantyhose</b> on!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I know, we should've been more prepared.

<i>Rachel</i>Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're <b title='exactly'>right</b> on time!

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, let's just go in there and face them.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ok? (they all agree) Ready?

<i>Joey</i>That's fire. Beats everything.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus <b title='put out - make a fire etc stop burning =extinguish'>putting the fire out</b>).<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.<br>
<i>All</i>Ok, ok. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's locked.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wha? Oh, sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, it's like: "Come on in, my <b title='↗arse, ass, buttock, bottom, rear, stern, posterior, tush, tushy, tushie'>butt</b> is surprisingly <b title='having a lot of hair'>hairy</b>".<br>

<i>Ross</i>(to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) <b title='used to show that you are extremely angry, disappointed etc'>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD</b> TAKE IT OFF! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of <b title='a light silver colored metal'>aluminum</b> <b title='very light thin sheets of metal '>foil</b> is slid under door)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)<br>
[cut to Monica and Chandler]<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's all the turkey you're gonna get.<br>
[cut to the hall]<br>
<i>Ross</i>How're we gonna decide who gets this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he <b title='stuff - push or put sth into a small space, esp in a quick careless way =shove'>stuffs</b> the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What're we gonna do? I'm <b title='very hungry'>starving</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah!<br>
[cut to Monica and Chandler]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, you touch that and <b title='used to tell sb that they will soon wish they had not done sth, esp because sb will be angry or punish them'>you'll be sorry</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Guys, I<b title='would'>'d</b> listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)<br>
[cut to the hall]<br>
(Rachel comes out of the apartment holding a pot. Joey holds in <b title='a feeling of excitement about sth pleasant or exciting that you know is going to happen ↗expectation'>anticipation</b> and Rachel opens it)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Huh... OH, MY GOD, IT'S <b title='Brussels sprout - a small round green vegetable that looks like a very small cabbage <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Brussels_sprout_closeup.jpg/220px-Brussels_sprout_closeup.jpg">'>BRUSSELS SPROUTS</b>. (they all look appalled)<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's worse than no food.<br>
[cut to Monica and Chandler]<br>
(Monica looks insulted)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>HA-HA! All you got was Monica's <b title='with a very unpleasant smell =smelly'>stinky</b> Brussels sprouts!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Stinky?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Please let me stay on this side of the door.<br>
[cut to hall]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They <b title='↗apparently, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>clearly</b> don't want to be with us.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what? I don't wanna be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not wanna be <b title='[adj] confident, thinks clearly, and does things in a sensible organized way '>together</b>, <b title='[adv] considered as whole'>together</b>! (Goes to unlock the door)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look <b title='them'>'em</b> in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm telling you. (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He <b title="↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">stares</b> at Ross like this without <b title='↗wink'>blinking</b>) I can do it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Staring back, and then <b title='If you break off when you are doing or saying sth, you suddenly stop doing it or saying it'>breaks off</b>) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!<br>
(Rachel finally <b title='manage to - succeed in doing sth difficult'>manages to</b> open the door, but the door chain is on.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
(Joey <b title='stick - put'>sticks</b> his head through the gap. Monica and Chandler are now sitting at the dinner table. There is another smaller table full of food standing in front of the front door)<br>
(Monica and Chandler do not look amused by Joeys head in the door)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...<br>
(Monica is now smiling)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The cranberries?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! Enough! A monkey could've made 'em!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(still with his head <b title='wedge - force sth firmly into a narrow space'>wedged</b> in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very, very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?<br>
(Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's and Phoebe's at the bottom)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I feel terrible.<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>So, so sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) <b title="used for getting sb's attention or introducing information">Now</b> let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The floating heads do make a good <b title='opinion/reason'>point</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So bad.<br>
<i>Ross </i>So bad.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So bad.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Gets up) Ok, ok. You two, (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Dessert?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to <b title='get sth from a shop etc'>pick up</b> the pies. You did remember, right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).<br>
(Monica takes it and reads the label)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Grand Supreme Little Darling?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Congratulatioooons!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really girls, not <b title='ok, friendly etc'>cool</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you man-heads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went <b title='in spite of the fact that you have just mentioned'>anyway</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this ok? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving <b title="used for emphasis and often used instead of the more offensive idioms for God's sake and for Christ's sake">for Pete's sakes</b>! A day of forgiveness!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a day to be thankful.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Too late for apologies.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't <b title='drool - let saliva (=the liquid in your mouth) come out of your mouth'>drooling</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ewww, is that what that is?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sorry!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! I'll cook!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! Let's go out.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! You three, have a nice Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Monica</i>The three of us?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!<br>
(Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel and Ross pull back their heads)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ha!<br>
(When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices he is stuck)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-oh! I'm stuck!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, that is not gonna work.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'll-I'll pull you through.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(in <b title='great pain ↗anguish, torment, torture'>agony</b>) Aaahh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's a little late for that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, well, this<b title='does'>'s</b> not change anything. (to Chandler) Ok, we need to get something to <b title='put grease (fatty or oily substance ) on sth to make it work smoothly ↗lubricate'>grease</b> the sides of his face.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uhm, we've got turkey grease.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bring it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...<br>
(Chandler gives Monica a <b title='being about one foot (12 inches / about 30 cm) in length'>footlong</b> <b title='used to transfer small quantities of liquids'>"eye dropper"</b> with the turkey grease in it)<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='Here is what you asked for'>Here you go</b>!<br>
(She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, that smells good!<br>
(And he starts licking the grease which <b title='trickle - if liquid trickles somewhere, it flows slowly and without force in a thin line'>trickles</b> down his face. Monica also <b title='squirt - force a liquid to move with great force ↗squint'>squirts</b> some on the other side of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, try it.<br>
(Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>It isn't working.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, we're gonna have to <b title='take the screws out of sth ↗screwdriver '>unscrew</b> the chain.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Can you ever feel your ears?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Interesting.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, where are your tools?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my <b title='a large vehicle with a broad metal blade at the front ↗tractor'>bulldozer</b>. I don't have tools!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well I do, but Rachel borrowed them.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I lent them to Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I gave them to Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I left them at the park.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to <b title='joke around with'>mess with</b> him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I've already <b title='stuff - push or put sth into a small space ↗shove'>stuffed</b> a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nice!<br>
(The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I have to <b title='answer/pick up the phone'>get that</b>. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's really starting to hurt.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, look, I'm, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, ok? Ok, so, PUSH!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Just <b title='a very short period of time'>a sec</b>, we're kind in the middle of something here.<br>
(Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Come on, guys, PUSH!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Come on!<br>
<i>Joey and Chandler</i>PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!<br>
(The chain breaks loose from the wall, and because Joey was pushing with all his might, he <b title='propel - move or push sb/sth forward ↗propeller'>propells</b> into the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. This table has wheels underneath it, and when Joey falls on this table, he rides into the living room, with all the food falling off, until finally Joey also falls off... Joey gets up quickly, a bit <b title='worried or upset ↗irritated'>agitated</b>, and acting as nothing happened. He is covered in food <b title='a mark left accidentally on clothes or surfaces'>stains</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>My cranberries!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looking at himself) <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, I got food all over me.<br>
(He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler a taste.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!<br>
(Monica enters from the spare bedroom.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(very emotional) I don't care.<br>
(Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That was the adoption agency.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And?<br>
<i>Monica</i>WE'RE GETTING A BABY!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you serious? (they <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>There's a pregnant woman in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Ohio_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Ohio_in_United_States.svg/270px-Ohio_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Ohio</b>, and she picked us!<br>
(They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm so happy for you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>This Thanksgiving <b title='kick ass - excel (do sth better)'>kicks last Thanksgiving's ass</b>!<br>
(They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the food off his shirt)
<s>Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table is <b title='set the table - put all the dishes, forks, knives etc onto a table ↗make the bed'>set</b>, and there's food on the tables again. They're all there, <b title='drink a toast to sb. If you drink a toast to sb, you drink sth in order to thank them, wish them luck etc'>toasting</b>.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>To Monica and Chandler... and that <b title='pregnant ↗conceive'>knocked up</b> girl in Ohio.<br>
<i>All</i>Cheers.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. Have you considered <b title='enter a (baby beauty) pageant.'>pageanting</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe they called, I mean we're <b title='in fact; really'>actually</b> getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I know how you feel.<br>
(Monica and Chandler are looking curiously at Joey.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure. I went through the exact same thing with <b title='his Cabbage Patch Kid'>Alicia Mae Emory</b>. The waiting, the wondering. Oh. Then one day... I get that call from <b title='a dedicated toy and juvenile-products retailer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us">Wiki</a>]'>Toys "R" Us</b>. She was <b title='available to buy'>in stock</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That is the exact same thing.<br>

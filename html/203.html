<s>Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Chandler is playing poker.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So how was Joan?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I <b title='↗dump'>broke up</b> with her.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh, Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Don't tell me, <b title='because'>'cause</b> of the big <b title='one of the two holes at the end of your nose ↗nasal'>nostril</b> thing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They were huge. When she <b title='sneeze - loudly blow air out of your nose in a sudden uncontrolled way ↗burp, belch, fart'>sneezed</b>, bats flew out of them.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='used to tell sb that you know that what they have just said was not true'>come on</b>, they were not that huge.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to add emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, she leaned back; I could see her brain.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How many perfectly fine women are you <b title='going to'>gonna</b> reject over the most <b title='of or on the surface only'>superficial</b> insignificant things?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='stop/delay'>Hold it</b>, hold it. I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> <b title='support'>side with</b> Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I <b title='↗ask out, date, engagement, move in'>went out</b> a couple of times with this girl, really <b title='sexy'>hot</b>, great kisser, but she had the biggest <b title='the lump at the front of your neck that moves when you talk or swallow [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_apple">Wiki</a>]'>Adam's apple</b>. <b title='drive - make sb/sth get into a bad or extreme state, usu an emotional one'>Drove</b> me <b title='crazy'>nuts</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) You or me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You guys are <b title='mess with - deceive sb or cause trouble for them'>messing with</b> me, right?<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is getting Ross and Chandler a beer.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, you name one woman that you broke up with for a actual real reason.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maureen Rosilla.<br>
<i>Ross</i>"<b title='because'>'Cause</b> she doesn't <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> <b title='a Greek pianist, keyboardist, composer, and music producer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanni">Wiki</a>]'>Yanni</b>," is not a real reason.<br>

<i>Mr. Heckles</i>I could have birds.<br>

<i>Mr. Heckles</i>Thank you. I'm going to <b title='go back to a group of people'>rejoin</b> my dinner party.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, bye-bye.<br>
(Monica closes the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being <b title='sb who is picky only likes specific things and is not easily pleased ↗choosy'>picky</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We'll give you Janice.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I miss Janice though. (<b title='imitate - copy the way sb behaves, speaks, moves etc ↗ape, copy, do, emulate, impersonate, mime, mock'>Imitating</b> Janice) "Hello, Chandler Bing."<br>

(Mr. Heckles bangs on his ceiling.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.<br>
(She stomps in protest. Heckles bangs again, which is answered by Monica and Rachel. Heckles bangs yet again, which is answered by everyone. There is no response.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We won. We won!<br>
[Cut to a man wrapped up on a sheet being wheeled out on a <b title='a light bed on wheels, used to move patients in a hospital'>gurney</b> with the <b title='a group of people'>gang</b> and Mr. Treeger looking on.]<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. (Screaming) Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.

[Cut to Phoebe and Ross.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>How can you not believe in evolution?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know, just don't. Look at this <b title='having a bad smell or a dirty appearance'>funky</b> shirt!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, and I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can-can <b title='used for showing that what you are saying is really true and not just an impressive way of describing sth'>literally</b> see them evolving through time.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? You can actually see it?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="used to emphasize a statement or to mean 'certainly' ↗definitely">You bet</b>. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See, I didn't know that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, <b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>there you go</b>.<br>

So I <b title='think'>figure</b> I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, you know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You've got to <b title='begin to feel better after an upsetting experience'>get over</b> this. Ok? You're-you're not gonna end up alone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I <b title='complain continuously'>bitch</b> about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, you have just described <b title='almost =practically'>virtually</b> every man that we have ever gone out with.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You are not a <b title='sb who looks strange or behaves in a strange way ↗weirdo, nerd, geek'>freak</b>. You're a guy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, honey, she's right. I mean you all do it. This-this one guy stopped <b title='be seeing sb - be having a romantic or sexual relationship with sb'>seeing</b> me because, because his cat didn't like me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, this guy dumped me because I fell asleep during <b title='a heavy metal band [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Sandwich">Wiki</a>]'>Spinal Tap</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You fell asleep during Spinal Tap?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Monica) Oh oh that Teddy, what's his name, in high school he stopped seeing you because he thought you were too fat.<br>
<i>Monica</i>He told me it was because he didn't have time for me because of the play.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, that's what I said. Anyway my <b title='main meaning/idea'>point</b> being, you are no different than the rest of them.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. Yeah, you are totally different.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>In a bad way?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be <b title='sb who is vulnerable can be easily harmed or hurt'>vulnerable</b>, and <b title='having an extremely close friendship ↗intimidate'>intimate</b> with someone.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You <b title='make it - manage to deal with a difficult experience'>made it</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're there!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You are ready to make a <b title='commitment in a relationship is the act of giving yourself, in whole, to the other person and the relationship. Staying faithful to the other person, being there whenever the other person needs you and accepting the other person, no matter what happens.'>commitment</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Whoa! Don't know about that.
<s>Mr. Heckles' Apartment, everyone is finishing cleaning up the apartment as Monica walks up to Rachel carrying the girlie clock.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. Um, I know you like this, and I-I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you.<br>
(The clock sounds it's alarm by whistling and having the girl shake her <b title='↗groin, crotch'>hips</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's fine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> tomorrow night. <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story etc'>This</b> woman Alison, from work, she is great. She's pretty. She's smart. And uh, I've been <b title='hold off - delay'>holding off</b> on asking her out in the past, because she has a, an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff <b title='hang up - delay, hinder'>hang me up</b> anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll take that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You want his yearbook?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he <b title='be a pain - be very annoying'>was kind of a pain</b>, he was, but he was a person. (She ends up standing behind the magnifying glass and everyone is laughing.) What? (Realizes.) You're all going to hell.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's really not that big!<br>
(Joey grabs the magnifying glass and walks out.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Joey) Taking that with you, huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you coming?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, just <b title='a very short period of time'>a second</b>. (Ross exits and Chandler picks up the broom and leans it up against the wall.) Goodbye Mr. Heckles. (He turns off the lights.) We'll try to <b title='keep down - hold under control or at a reduced level, e.g. "Keep your voice down."'>keep it down</b>.
<s>A Restaurant, Chandler is on his date with Allison.</s>
<i>Allison</i>Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the <b title='the classified ads in a newspaper'>classifieds</b> and see "Philosopher wanted?"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure. (In his head.) My God, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get <b title='hang up - cause to have an emotional or psychological preoccupation (a state in which you think about sth so much that you do not think about other things) or problem ↗obessive'>hung up</b> on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Chandler! Chandler! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop <b title='kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b> and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! I saw what you were doing to my sister! Get out here!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we <b title='have a long period of time when you are successful or happy'>had a good run</b>. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, goodbye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the <b title='↗patio, terrace, porch'>balcony</b> window.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you doing?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I'm going <b title='to be escaping, esp from the police'>on the lam</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to <b title='push in'>stick</b> his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) <b title='wait'>Hold on</b>! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. <b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up</b> <b title='brother'>bro</b>?<br>
(Ross <b title='spot - notice'>spots</b> Chandler and starts <b title='↗pursue, follow, go after'>chasing</b> him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, the hell, are you doing?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(running from the guy's apartment with Joey <b title='following closely behind'>in tow</b>) Ok, what's-what's going on?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='panic, panicked, panicking'>panicking</b>) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>! He's <b title='exactly'>right</b> there!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, we're not just <b title='mess around - have sex or a sexual relationship with sb, esp when you should not'>messing around</b>! I love her. Ok, I'm in love with her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. Sorry, but it-it's true, I love him too.<br>
(There's a brief pause.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He <b title='↗snuggle, cuddle, huddle, embrace'>hugs</b> them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) Oh-oh, sorry, you-you guys <b title='want to'>wanna</b> probably get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Awww, no, it's ok, we've actually known for a while.<br>
(There's another pause as Ross gets angry again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel back up against the door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Ross, we were worried about you. Ok? We didn't know how you were <b title='going to'>gonna</b> react.<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, all right, whew! <b title='used to ask sb if they agree with a suggestion'>What do you say</b> we all clear out of here and let these two <b title='two people who show by their behavior that they love each other very much '>lovebirds</b> get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.) Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one <b title='do - have sex with'>doing</b> your sister.
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, everyone is there.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys <b title='at any time'>ever</b> have kids...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(quickly) I <b title='request/demand'>call</b> godfather!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You can't just call godfather. Don't you think her brother should be godfather?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, big <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalk_%28dance%29">Moonwalk (dance)</a>]'>zero gravity moon steps</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, I'll <b title='chip in/contribute'>go in on</b> that with you! I couldn't think of anything.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
(A girl enters.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.<br>
<i>Katie</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello Katie.<br>
<i>All</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, you ready to go?<br>
<i>Katie</i>Yeah, I just <b title='have go to'>gotta</b> run to the bathroom.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)<br>
<i>Katie</i>Hey, where're we going to lunch?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh I was thinking maybe <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_food">Wiki</a>]'>Chinese food</b>.<br>
<i>Katie</i>Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! (She hits him repeatedly as she says that.)<br>
(She <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> to the bathroom and Joey sits back down.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She is so cute! You could fit her right in little pocket!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She could fit in <b title="It's for a pocket-watch, like in olden times. You can also carry changes in it.">that little pocket inside the pocket</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...<br>
<i>Monica</i>But what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='↗sheepish'>shyly</b>) She keeps punching me.<br>
(They all laugh.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>In that cute, little, <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> way she just did?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Ok? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>O see, I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after <b title='a school for children between two and five years of age'>preschool</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is <b title='beat up - hurt sb badly by hitting them'>beating him up</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look, honey, I know this must be really, really <b title='involving a lot of problems and causing a lot of trouble or worry ↗hard, tough'>difficult</b> for you and I - Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
<s>Ross's apartment, he's unpacking after moving in. There's a knock on the door and he answers it.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Aww.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Bread, so you never go hungry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well you know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
(The door across the hall opens and a guy walks into Ross's apartment.)<br>
<i>Guy</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Guy</i>Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah, <b title='sb who has the highest position in a company or organization'>president</b> of the <b title='tenant - sb who pays rent for the use of land or a building ↗landlord, lease'>tenants</b> committee.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Oh hi Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mr. President.<br>
<i>Steve</i>I uh, came to talk to you about Howard.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Howard?<br>
<i>Steve</i>Yeah, he's the <b title="sb whose job is to repair things and do other types of practical work in people's houses ↗superintendent, janitor">handyman</b>. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is <b title='kick in - join with others in giving money =chip in'>kicking in</b> a 100 <b title='dollars'>bucks</b> as a kind of thank you for all the hard work type of thing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh that's nice.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Yeah. So, you wanna give a check? Or...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. Uhh...<br>
<i>Steve</i>Oh look, you don't have to give it too me <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>! You can slip it under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Oh, ok, I <b title='understand'>get</b> it. (Starts to leave.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Howard's the handyman!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes but to me he's just, man.<br>
<i>Steve</i>Ok, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Phoebe) Ugh, <b title='used when you are very surprised or shocked'>can you believe that guy</b>?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. I really like his glasses.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Ross is <b title='lament - express your sadness, regret, or disappointment about sth ↗whine'>lamenting</b> to Chandler and Rachel about his troubles in his new building.</s>
<i>Ross</i>...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a <b title='sb who is unwilling to spend money'>cheapskate</b>, and now the whole building <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hates</b> me! You know a little kid spit on my knee! And told me to wipe it off with my $100 <b title='↗paper money, note'>bill</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looks at Ross' knee) You really should wipe it off with something.<br>
(Ross looks and gets a towel off the counter and wipes it off. Then, he throws it back on the counter in disgust.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna <b title='organize a party and invite people'>throw a party</b>. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them, that I am not a bad guy. I am not a <b title='not liking to spend money'>cheap</b> guy! I'm just a guy who-who <b title='support, defend, refuse to accept unfair treatment'>stands up for</b> what he believes in. A man, with principles.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? Party's gonna cost you <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> more than that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Ok, I gotta run. I gotta go get some <b title='↗badge'>nametags</b>. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Umm, Chandler, you-you <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wh-wh-why?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, because she loves you and because you love her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, Chandler, don't <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak out</b>! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she <b title='↗dump'>broke up</b> with Richard because he didn't wanna have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and you know, it's Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't see it that way. Ok? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to <b title='have a romantic relationship with sb =go out with'>date</b>. Now, <b title='used to say that nobody can know sth'>who's to say</b> what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, <b title='↗definitely, certainly'>absolutely</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. An-an-and you know I'm completely different from Richard anyway. Because he's an eye doctor, and I don't wear glasses.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. It's not different at all, is it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Not unless different means the same.
<s>Central Perk, Joey is sitting on the couch with Katie.</s>
<i>Katie</i>You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a <b title='sb who is crazy or behaves strangely'>nut</b>! (She <b title='↗spank, slam, smack'>slaps</b> her <b title='calf, shin, lap'>thighs</b>, Joey <b title='jerk - move with a quick sudden movement ↗recoil, flinch'>jerks</b>, and spills some of his coffee.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='set - put'>sets</b> the coffee down) You know, breadstick <b title='fang - a long sharp tooth of an animal'>fangs</b> are always funny so-<br>
<i>Katie</i>No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and he retreats to the arm of the couch.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhh, look Katie, uh, listen, we-we need to talk. Ok? Umm, look, I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Ok? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.<br>
<i>Katie</i>Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't <b title='↗laugh at, mock'>make fun of</b> me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the couch.)
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Monica are <b title='↗snuggle, cuddle'>curled</b> up on one of the chairs.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Isn't this great?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes <b title='move into a particular position suddenly'>snap</b> open.) Chandler, couldn't you just stay here forever?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, here, somewhere else, you know where-where ever. (Gets up.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you ok?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'm <b title='calm ↗relaxed, breezy'>cool</b>. Casual.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What-what're you doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm just <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b>. You know, having fun. You know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used as an interjection'>Man</b>, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you do want all that stuff, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh and you know what I want!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes! You want babies! You have baby <b title='↗maniac, mania'>fever</b>!<br>

<i>Guest #2</i>(sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a thing like that?<br>
(Steve goes over to look at Ross who's trying to look <b title='calm'>cool</b>, but has some <b title='a sweet substance put on cakes'>frosting</b> on his lip.)<br>
<i>Steve</i>3-B!<br>
<i>All</i>Oh yeah, aww!<br>
<i>Steve</i>Ok, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!<br>
<i>Guest #3</i>Yeah, leave!<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah, get out! Now!<br>
<i>Steve</i>Go back to 3-B, 3-B!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, no, every-everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked "Who here likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then <b title='from the time when sth happens'>once</b> I <b title='get to know - gradually begin to know'>got to know</b> him I saw that he's really sweet and <b title='↗affectionate, helpful, sympathetic, kind'>caring</b> and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him, all right? I mean you know, I like all you guys now, but when I first met you you know Kurt, I thought, you know, <b title='rude or unkind'>abrasive</b> <b title='sb who is drunk ↗alcoholic'>drunk</b>, umm Lola, <b title='extremely boring ↗numb'>mind-numbingly</b> stupid! And ok, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a <b title='aged between 20 and 29'>20-something</b> woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) <b title='an attractive woman who uses her looks to get money from rich men'>Gold digger</b>, (To the old guy) <b title='the act of having a sexual relationship with a much younger person'>cradle robbing</b> <b title='pervert - sb whose sexual behavior is considered strange and unpleasant by most people'>perv</b>! So, I think you all know what I mean.
<s>Ross's apartment, Ross and Phoebe have been <b title='not be allowed to stay in a particular place ↗evict, exile'>banished</b> to Ross's place.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>Obviously</b> I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting them, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not <b title='understand'>get</b> that.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Chandler comes running in. Everyone else is already there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(raising her hand) I'm Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I need to talk to you, it's urgent!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I've been doing a lot of thinking, about us, you know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait what-wh-wh-what're you doing?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(getting out a ring box) Monica...<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Will you marry me?<br>
(Phoebe hides her eyes in shame. Rachel is starring at them wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Joey and Ross are <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b> to temporary silence.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh-no. No. No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What a bad idea!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, why are you doing this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid, to do this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm doing this because I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> fourth you know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'm <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> wishing everyone wasn't here right now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who? Two divorces and Joey?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>She's right you know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, but still, <b title='a comment sb makes which you think is unfair or unkind'>cheap shot</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what? You know when I said that I want you to, deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I didn't think I was!<br>
(They hug.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, what would've you done if I said yes?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well I would've been happy, because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Everyone is there.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I will not!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, it's ok. You don't have to be so <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> about it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?<br>
(They all laugh.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no wait Pheebs, I think with something like that you just ask them to <b title='start living with sb in the same home'>move in with</b> you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, how long is this gonna go on.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well I think the length of <b title='tease - laugh at sb and make jokes in order to have fun by embarrassing them'>teasing</b> is directly related to how insane you were, so, a long time.<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is fun. Oh-hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs- <b title='whine - make a long, high, sad sound'>whines</b> as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's not funny.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not funny at all!<br>
(They all get up and leave.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>You said you<b title='would'>'d</b> marry Joey?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>OK, you have to realize, I was <b title='↗fatigue, worn out'>exhausted</b>, I was emotional, I would've said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married. (Long pause) I'm not helping.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to <b title='let go - stop holding/thinking/etc sth'>let that go</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe <b title='start up means the same as start'>start things up</b> again, you were, engaged to my best friend.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well (Looks at Ross <b title='quizzical - seeming to ask a question'>quizzically</b>) Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, Joey's my NO! Nah-ah! (points at Rachel)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Enters) Hey you guys I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='leave'>take off</b>. I just wanted to, say goodbye.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rachel said she'd marry you?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(He looks around the room) This isn't the right room, sorry <b title='people'>folks</b>. (leaves)
<s>Monica, Phoebe, Joey & Chandler are at Ross & Rachel's waiting for them to come home.</s>
<i>Monica</i>OK, I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> be negative so I'll say that most of the <b title='↗banner'>signs</b> you bought are good.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No they ran out of "It's a girl" (the sign says "It's a boy") but I can, I can fix this one, (she writes "not" in between it's and a) See? Uh?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (to Chandler) Honey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. Do you have a- (pulls the balloon out of his mouth)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey why-why don't you go lie down.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Why're you so tired?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I couldn't sleep last night. You know, then I started worrying about this big <b title='relating to a division ↗department'>divisional</b> meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep, you know, and I was like, if I fall asleep now, I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now, I'll get 5 hours sleep. Not matter what I did, I-I couldn't fall asleep.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(enters with Emma) Hi!<br>
<i>Everyone</i>Hi, welcome home!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe did the signs.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you guys, thanks for doing this.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look at all the <b title='things'>stuff</b> people sent!<br>

What're people think? (reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey so uh, where's Ross?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, he's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, is he still mad at us?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you more then me, but he can't stay too mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not fair! I can't do that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I'm-I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.<br>
<i>Joey</i>See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody (looks at Chandler) said he'd be <b title='get over - begin to feel better after an upsetting experience'>over</b> it <b title='at the present time ↗right now'>by now</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

But many of our field offices have reported disappointing <b title='yield - the amount of profits, crops etc that sth produces'>yields</b>.

<i>Rachel</i>God how long do you think that's gonna last?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I don't know, he <b title='get over - begin to feel better after an upsetting experience'>got over</b> the "we were on a break" thing really quickly.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what? I can't even worry about that <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>, <b title='because'>'cause</b> I got the <b title='sb who is attractive'>cutie</b> little baby, oh, I can't believe how much I love her, I mean I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her, I actually, miss her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know that's-that's her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I know, but she's sleeping. You know it's not like when she's awake and I can see her stretch and <b title='move with small movements from side to side or up and down'>wiggle</b>. Oh, my God, have you seen her <b title='open your mouth wide and breathe in deeply because you are tired or bored ↗yarn'>yawn</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh it's so cute.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. When do you think she's gonna wake up?<br>
<i>Phobe</i>Oh, she told me to <b title='(of telephone) call'>ring</b> her if she's not <b title='not in bed'>up</b> by 11. She has a job interview. (Laughs. Monica and Rachel are not amused) Ok, but the clouds part when she yawns.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God, look at her sleeping, oh, I love her so much, I think I'm gonna wake her up.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never, supposed to wake a sleeping baby.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh I'm sorry, oh, mummy's so sorry, go back to sleep, shh shh shh, shh shh! Go back to sleep.<br>
(Emma continues crying in the background)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Breaks your heart, doesn't it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It really does. How long do you think we have to stay?
<s>Chandlers meeting continues.</s>
<i>Ms. McKenna</i>Ok if everyone's <b title='in agreement with a plan'>on board</b>, it's <b title='all been decided and arranged'>settled</b>, Chandler, (Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he then wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ms. McKenna</i>Are you on board?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(not knowing what he's saying yes to) Yes.<br>
<i>Ms. McKenna</i>Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in <b title='the second-largest city in Oklahoma [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Oklahoma_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Oklahoma_in_United_States.svg/270px-Oklahoma_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Tulsa</b>. You're gonna love Oklahoma.<br>
(Chandler smiles and nods then realizes what he's agreed to.)

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, <b title='changing her diaper'>changing her</b>, <b title='help her burp'>burping her</b>, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>OK (starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)<br>
<i>Monica</i>It worked!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh (happily) oh no just stopped to <b title='vomit ↗nausea, sick, retch, gag, puke'>throw up</b> a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, "she", Rach, not "it", "she."<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I'm not so sure.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my god, I am <b title="lose sb's mind - become mentally ill or very worried, bored etc">losing my mind</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, no kidding, all right? This just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross.
<s>Ross in Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b> getting Rachel her muffin.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins <b title='↗for here, takeaway, takeout'>to go</b>? (He puts a bag with dippers in it on the counter.)<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Dippers huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='yes'>Yep</b>.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>So I guess Rachel had you baby?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yep, can you believe it?<br>
<i>Gunther</i><b title='no'>Nope</b>, I can't even believe she slept with you <b title='in/at the beginning'>in the first place</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh? Oh-oh (laughs) you, you mean like a? Huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Comes in.) Hey. (smiles, Ross just ignores him and turns back round) Ross, I know you're <b title='annoyed ↗mad'>pissed</b> at me, but we have to talk about this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ah actually, uh we don't. (Walks off)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine, ok, fine. But I gotta say, <b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>technically</b>, I didn't even do anything wrong.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(turns back) What? (angry) You-you didn't do anything wrong?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I-I said I didn't technically.<br>
<i>Ross</i>OK, let's put aside the fact that you (<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes">Air quotes</a>]'>finger quote-mark gesture</b>) "accidentally" picked up my grandmother's ring and you (again) "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, can I just stop you <b title='exactly'>right</b> there for a second? When people do this (finger quote-mark gesture), I don't really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?<br>
<i>Ross</i>And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know. I should've. (quote-mark gesture) "I'm sorry."<br>
<i>Ross</i>Not using it right, Joe.<br>
(He brings his hands in closer to his face then does it again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm gonna go.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, <b title='encourage sb to do sth'>come on</b>! (he grabs his bag so he cant leave) Look, Ross, we have to <b title='↗get over'>get past</b> this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Give me the bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Now you should scream at me or-or <b title='say a word or an expression which is not polite and shows that you are very angry'>curse</b> me or <b title='↗punch'>hit</b> me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm not gonna hit you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why not, you'll feel better, I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I don't.<br>
<i>Joey</i>A little bit.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Little bit.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(excited) A little bit more.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Give me the bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, hit me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Give me the bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hit me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey, give me the bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hit me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joe, I'm not kidding.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(interrupting) Hit me, hit me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(shouts) Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<br>
(Ross goes crazy and goes to <b title='hit ↗kick'>punch</b> him, but Joey gets out of the way and Ross punchs his hand against the <b title='↗post'>pole</b>. Ross then screams from the pain and turns to Gunther, and Gunther has <b title='↗grin'>a huge smile</b> on his face.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You <b title='duck - lower your head or body very quickly, esp to avoid being seen or hit'>ducked</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm sorry! It was a reflex! <br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my god, this-this really hurts!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn't and Joey punches Ross in the eye. Gunther looks very happy.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What is the matter with you?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You were supposed to duck! Why didn't you duck?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Good, good, yeah, (grabs the bags) maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) "<b title='said when you made a small mistake'>Oops</b>"

<s>Emma is still crying.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Try feeding her again.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I already fed her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, that's why I said again!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alright you guys, we can't <b title='attack'>turn on</b> each other, ok? that's just what she wants.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Actually Pheebs it's more of a husband and wife kind of thing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I knew I should've married Chandler.<br>
(Phoebe and Rachel go to the back room and Emma continues to cry in the background while Chandler and Monica talk.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>OK, <b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?' / 'What happened?'">what's up</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>OK, umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year?

<i>Monica</i><b title='used to politely ask sb to repeat sth they have said ↗sorry, what, pardon'>Excuse me</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>OK, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, I think you actually met her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't care, get back to Tulsa!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and <b title='according to the way a situation appears ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b>, said yes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(stands up angrily) Tulsa, Oklahoma?!<br>

<i>Ms. McKenna</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's a funny story, actually. (coughs) Uh, I kind of fell asleep, in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.<br>
<i>Ms. McKenna</i>You fell asleep?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But only because I was <b title='not in bed'>up</b> all night worried about this meeting, <b title='am/are/is/have/has not'>ain't</b> that funny? <b title='a situation that is unusual or amusing because the opposite of what is expected happens'>Irony</b>?

Please don't make me go there!<br>
<i>Ms. McKenna</i>Chandler, I-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no no! I know that you're upset. But, uh, I just, I would really rather just stay here, not here in your office. Here, here at the company, where I'm rapidly feeling unwelcome. Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh, what a great picture of your son, <b title='tall and strong, and looking healthy'>strapping</b>... that's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely, I like a girl with a strong jaw.

<i>Ross</i>Ah, I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad, you should see him.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, Ross! This is not good, please, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) All right, you have got to get over this Joey thing, ok? I never really wanted to marry Joey, ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>OK.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I've been doing some thinking about who should be my <b title='The principal bridesmaid [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_of_honor">Wiki</a>] ↗best man'>maid of honor</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it's you!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we can <b title='think of'>come up with</b> a system where we <b title='If you trade off one thing against another, you exchange all or part of one thing for another, as part of a negotiation or compromise. ↗barter, butler'>trade off</b> being maid of honor for each other.

<i>Monica</i>Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> do it once and no one would get upset.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah that's actually a <b title='fairly/rather/quitevery'>pretty</b> good idea.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wh-why is that the best part?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because then I don't have to!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you!

<s>Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I don't think Joey and Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And they're on the same couch. Which means they're sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasn't been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

<i>Joey</i>Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>What're you talking about?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Like when I want a job, right? I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, I get the <b title='character/role'>part</b>, you know?

<i>Chandler</i>Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! You know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know. But you know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as <b title='two people who are married or having a sexual or romantic relationship'>a couple</b> is to know that you are truly <b title='in the same place where sth is'>in the presence of</b> love.

<i>Phoebe</i>Really?! I won!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why-why would I care about that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.<br>
(Joey gets up and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the door. After a pause Ross decides to join him.)
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from Julie's.</s>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Though that went bad'>As bad as that went</b> I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm gonna apologize for all of the stupid things that I do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I would really love it if could do both.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, I have to ask.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she've gained?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='65.83 kg'>A hundred and forty-five pounds</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her <b title='a group of people who are related to each other'>family</b>! And that's not the <b title='main meaning/idea'>point</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. Ok, now wait a minute that was totally different.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What if I have babies, ok? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm ok with that, but I'm not sure that you are!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a <b title='↗slim, slender, skinny'>thin</b>, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Ok? And I am in love with Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Keep going.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'd carry you around in my pocket.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Yeah, and you know you-you deserve to win. And-and you know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started <b title='put together - prepare or produce sth by collecting things ↗put away'>putting some stuff together</b>, you know just in case...<br>

Oh and here's a little <b title='a small bag'>purse</b> that I found. (Hands her the purse) You know I just thought they could maybe, hold the rings in there.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>So umm- And umm, <b title='old, but high quality ↗vintage car'>vintage</b> handkerchiefs you know 'cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>This stuff is great!<br>

(Starts to cry again.) Yeah...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You do? Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>'Cause I think it means more to you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But Pheebs, you know you earned it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14? (She's referring to the Halloween picture.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I was ten. I just <b title='↗puberty, teenager'>developed</b> early.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, we just decided that Rachel is going to be your maid of honor.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(gasps) Ohh, wow! That's great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh, wow! Ok, we really have to start planning! I've-I've a lot of really <b title='detailed and exact'>specific</b> ideas!

<i>Ross</i>It really was.<br>
(Suddenly Rachel clears her throat and the camera cuts to the rest of the <b title='group of people'>gang</b> staring at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the gang.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(reacting first by jumping up) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>You know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
<s>Chandler and Joey's Chandler is talking with his mom.</s>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Hey kiddo, car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. <b title='↗signature, biography, autobiography, auto- (of or by yourself)'>Autographed</b>. And give you a goodbye kiss. So, Mmah (Kisses him) here's the kiss, here's the goodbye, anything you want from <b title='the capital and the largest city of Portugal [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Wiki</a>]'>Lisbon</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You kissed my best Ross! ... Or something <b title="used when you are giving the general meaning of sth, rather than the exact words ↗more or less, approximately, roughly">to that effect</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>(Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really stupid.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really really stupid.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Really really stupid. <b title='↗Are we good'>Are we ok</b> now?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. No. No...
<s>Cut to the hallway, Joey is listening to Chandler and his mom's conversation through the door as Ross walks up.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='↗shush'>Shh</b>. He did it. He <b title="tell sb off - speak to sb angrily about sth wrong that sb have done">told her off</b>, and not just about the kiss, about everything.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're kidding.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wait wait, then she <b title='come back - reply to sb quickly, often in an angry or unkind way'>came back</b> with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>'Ok, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"<br>
<i>Joey</i>That <b title='make sense - be sensible/reasonable'>makes more sense</b>, yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, what's going on now?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I <b title="do not know">dunno</b>, I've been standing here <b title="spell sth out - explain sth clearly and in detail">spelling it out</b> for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the <b title='=peephole, spyhole <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Peephole.jpg/220px-Peephole.jpg">'>spy hole</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="What do ya (you)">Whaddya</b> see?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming <b title='exactly'>right</b> at us! Run! Run!<br>
(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Monica and Rachel's apartment, but it is locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn't listening. Chandler and his mom come out)<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>You ok, kiddo?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, ok.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Alright. You be good. (Kisses him)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="'Drive safely' is correct - but I think you'll hear 'Drive safe' very often in conversation, even though it's theoretically wrong. [<a href='http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=1632153'>link</a>]">Drive safe</b>.<br>
(She walks down the hall)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Very politely) Mrs. Bing.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Mr. Geller.<br>
(She leaves)<br>
(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel's door)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You mean that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. How'd it go?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Awful. Awful. Couldn't gone worse.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, how do you feel?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pretty good! I told her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, you know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Points to Chandler, then puts his finger down) But.. we don't have to <b title='take a particular course of action'>go down that road</b>.<br>
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is <b title="hand out - give sth to each person in a group =distribute">handing out</b> copies of her book to the gang.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Ok? Oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her <b title="moving up and down with large regular movements">heaving</b> <b title="breasts">beasts</b>'.<br>

<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica is trying on a pair of new boots as Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! So what do you think?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>New haircut? (Monica nods 'No.') Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods 'Yes.') Boots!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! <b title="used for getting sb's attention or introducing information">Now</b>, they're a little more than I usually spend on boots...or rent (Shows him the <b title='a piece of paper that shows that goods or services have been paid for'>receipt</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did you say you bought boots, or boats?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> miss being able to afford food.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> too expensive for you."<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She had a <b title='idea, opinion, reason'>point</b>. (Shows her the receipt.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh, Monica. Those boots are amazing!<br>
<i>Monica</i>They're mine!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, I'm not returning them. Ok? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm gonna wear them <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>. You'll see. <b title='↗plus'>Besides</b>, I love the <b title='compliment - sth that shows you admire sb/sth ↗complement'>compliments</b>. I mean, have you ever had something that was so beautiful that everyone wants it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I have you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. <b title='used to say sb has not been successful in doing sth, esp in persuading you or tricking you'>Nice try</b>; I'm keeping the boots.
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is talking to Rachel's, who is now showing, stomach.</s>
<i>Ross</i>That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How can you let him talk to your <b title='the part of the body where the legs join at the top, including the area around the genitals (the outer sexual organs) ↗groin, loins'>crotch</b> like that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(pause) He's talking to the baby.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh! Ok! Ok, <b title='because'>'cause</b> when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Well, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go you guys. I'll see you later.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talking to my sister and she knows you work at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren">Wiki</a>]'>Ralph Lauren</b>...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, <b title="used to emphasize that you are saying 'no' to sth ↗no way, not really">forget it</b>! <b title='used to say that you will definitely not do sth'>No way</b>! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, you know, give her some advice.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I guess I can talk to one of my <b title='supervisor - sb who is in charge of an activity, a place, or a group of people such as workers or students'>supervisors</b>...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, so will you meet with her?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! I'd love to! Have her <b title='visit ↗come over, drop by, stop by'>come by</b> the office.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, you know the <b title='a standardized test for most college admissions in the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">Wiki</a>]'>SATs</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>She took <b title='them'>'em</b>!<br>
(Joey goes to get coffee and Rachel exits as the camera <b title='pan - (of a film camera) to move slowly from one side to another or up and down'>pans</b> to Phoebe and Ross on the couch.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, activist, actor and philanthropist. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_%28musician%29">Wiki</a>]'>Sting</b> has a son that goes there too!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah I know, he's in Ben's class.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur <b title='things'>stuff</b> you tell us?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he <b title='groan - make a deep sad sound =moan'>groans</b> and exits.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What are you reading? The Kidnapper's Guide to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">Wiki</a>]'>Manhattan</b> Private Schools?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, it's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_%28magazine%29">Wiki</a>]'>New York magazine</b>. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So, how well do you know Sting?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, I actually haven't even met him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh, yeah, that's too bad. I really <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well actually, I'm <b title='pick up - go and meet sb/sth, and take them somewhere (usu in a car)'>picking Ben up</b> tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='go ahead'>There you go</b>! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
<s>Central Perk, the next day Rachel, Phoebe, and Chandler are there as Monica enters.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey guys!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi boots.<br>
<i>Monica</i>See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to <b title='↗hooker, prostitute'>pay for them</b>. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! They're beautiful!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahh...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(almost crying) They hurt so much!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I can't just <b title='give away - give sth to sb because you do not want or need it for yourself ↗give up'>give them away</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well then get your money back and return them!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't do that either! The <b title='sole - the bottom part of a shoe ↗heel'>soles</b> are already a little <b title='scuff - make marks on the surface of sth by rubbing it against sth rough ↗scrape, graze'>scuffed</b> up and the insides are filled with my blood.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(returning to his seat) Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(spinning around looking for him) I don't think you did a very thorough job!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I <b title='drop off - take sb somewhere'>dropped him off</b> at Carol's. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it <b title='turn out - end up, prove to be'>turns out</b> that I'm not gonna get those tickets <b title='however'>though</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, no! Why not?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, it turns out Ben and Sting's son do not <b title='have a friendly relationship'>get along</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='why'>How come</b>?!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to say that you have heard that sth is true, although you are not completely sure about it ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b>, Sting's son <b title='↗laugh at'>made fun of</b> the fact that Ben's moms are <b title="lesbianism - the condition of being a lesbian.">lesbianisms</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait! But Ross, if they don't get along then you should <b title='smooth over - make a problem seem less serious'>smooth things over</b>. Make them be friends.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure you can! Give them some <b title="block - child's wooden or plastic toy brick">blocks</b>, put them in a <b title='an enclosed area with four sides designed for a small child to play inside in safety'>playpen</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Playpen?! Ben's seven!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, "Yes.") (To the rest) He's really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I-I just can't do it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes you can! Sting says so himself!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(singing) Rosssss can!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(singing) Rossss can!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, I...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!<br>
(Ross runs out to get the tickets.)

Let's see, there's design, but you may need a <b title='an intensified version of "another" [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061017065148AAL9u0N">link</a>]'>whole nother</b> <b title='academic title ↗diploma, certificate'>degree</b> for that.

<i>Ben</i>Aunt Phoebe, what're you doing here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all ok. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.<br>
<i>Ben</i>Jack? I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> him! He's a <b title='sb who does stupid, annoying, or unkind things'>jerk</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh it's ok. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.<br>
<i>Dr. Long</i>Here she is!<br>
(Dr. Long hands her to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh hey you. Oh. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.<br>
<i>Dr. Long</i>Do we have a name yet?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, not yet.<br>
<i>Dr. Long</i>That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.<br>
(Ross and Rachel look into each other's eyes and kiss.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hello, baby girl.
<s>The Recovery Room, Ross is taking pictures of Rachel holding the baby as the rest of the <b title='group of people'>gang</b> enters.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Can we come in?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, come on in.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>There she is!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, she's so beautiful.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Here. (Hands her to Monica.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's incredible, I mean <b title='one minute ... the next (minute) ... - used to say that a situation suddenly changes'>one minute</b> she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) You know what I mean! She's this <b title='used for emphasis'>whole</b> tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh no-no-no, it's ok, for a second there counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, my turn, my turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe and says "Aunt Phoebe".) Yes. Oh baby. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could <b title='as a sign of affection'>squeeze</b> your little head! (Pause) I won't.<br>
(Rachel starts crying again.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey what's the matter?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing I'm... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.<br>
<i>Ross</i>The doctor says it's completely normal with all the <b title='hormone - a natural substance produced by your body that influences its growth, development, and condition [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone">Wiki</a>]'>hormones</b>. <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b>, you-you're sleep <b title='not having the things that are essential for a comfortable life'>deprived</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's the matter now?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I was <b title='relive - remember clearly an experience that happened in the past'>reliving</b> it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, and you know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! Umm, ok uh...everyone...this...is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So then I guess <b title='Queen Isabella & King Ferdinand [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_and_Isabella">Wiki</a>]'>Ferdinand</b> is <b title='not to be considered or permitted'>out</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What was the other one Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Umm, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delilah">Wiki</a>]'>Delilah</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a <b title='relating to or based on the Bible'>biblical</b> <b title='a female prostitute (sb who is paid to have sex with people) ↗hooker, hussy, tramp'>whore</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yay!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well what're we gonna do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's ok honey, you'll find a name.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are gonna be.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I've had <b title='them'>'em</b> <b title='pick out - choose sb/sth from a group'>picked out</b> since I was fourteen.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no, it's gonna be named after some <b title='a small amount of food that you eat between meals'>snack</b> or baked good isn't it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well tell us! What are they?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, ok. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And if it's a girl?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't wanna say.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. It's Emma.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don't want it. Do you have any other totally perfect names that you're not gonna use?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Take it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='The baby'>It</b>'s clearly an Emma.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh honey, but you love that name.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but I love you more. Besides, you know, nothing <b title='go with - seem good, natural, or attractive in combination with sth'>goes with</b> Bing. So I'm <b title='in trouble or in a bad situation'>screwed</b>. (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh. Hi, Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Emma. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do I look like a giant <b title='a cell produced by the sex organs of a male person or animal ↗semen'>sperm</b> to all of you, or...?
<s>A <b title='janitor - sb who attends to the maintenance or cleaning of a building ↗superintendent'>Janitorial</b> <b title='a small room'>Closet</b>, Monica and Chandler are emerging slowly.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>That was amazing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know. Oh. Hey, do you realize that we may've just changed our lives forever? We may've started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And if <b title="we can't be in a hospital">not</b>, we got to do it on a bucket.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you so much.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah? (They kiss)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey? You-you wanna <b title='have sex'>do it</b> again. This time just for us?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Probably.
<s>The Recovery Room, Rachel is putting Emma down for a nap.</s>
<i>Janice</i>(entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and <b title='recoil - move quickly back from sb/sth frightening or unpleasant'>recoils</b> in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?<br>
<i>Janice</i>He's a <b title='from football, but referring to sb/sth that you like'>keeper</b>. (Looks at Emma) Aww, look at the little <b title='a nice friendly small child [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin">Wiki</a>]'>munchkin</b>. Don't you worry, because by the time you're old enough to <b title='have a romantic relationship with'>date</b> him, he's gonna have a different nose. How're you feeling?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I'm fine.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Can I just say, I-I really admire what you're doing. Just <b title='↗bring up'>raising</b> her all alone.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and he gets married?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!<br>
<i>Janice</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b> Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New <b title="boob - a woman's breast">Boobs</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Janice</i>I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on your own.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well... That's...you know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes and we're doing ok. Besides, you know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, <b title='because'>'cause</b> <b title='recently'>lately</b> I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, you know? And right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. You know? So it might be the...the beginning of something.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey, Janice!<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who's this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)<br>
<i>Janice</i>Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no. No.<br>
<i>Janice</i>I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Bye. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>! <b title='Apparently his nose is very big'>You see the kid on that nose</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and <b title='set - put'>sets</b> in on a chair.) You know what I was, I was thinking about?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...you know, we can't let that happen again, you know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(pause) Right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I mean we don't wanna go down that road, do we?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No, of course not. No. That's why I <b title='bring up - mention a subject or start to talk about it'>brought it up</b>. (Pause) They didn't have any <b title='soda - a sweet drink containing bubbles'>sodas</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
<s>Outside the <b title='an area in a hospital where new babies are taken care of until they go home'>Nursery</b>, Ross is looking at Emma as Phoebe walks up.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>She in there?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma down.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Isn't it amazing how every baby is beautiful? Except that one. What is this? A <b title='A petting zoo or a petting farm is a place with animals which small children can safely stroke or play with'>petting zoo</b>? Ooh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, look at Emma!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just can't decide who she looks more <b title='adv. in a similar way'>alike</b>, you or Rachel?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh what're you kidding? She's <b title='very beautiful'>gorgeous</b>, it's all Rachel.<br>
(Pause)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's...it's complicated ok?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, we've been together. Ok? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now, we have a baby. (Pause) It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't <b title='prove effective or successful'>work out</b>...I can never do that to Emma. I mean she-she came into this world thinking everything-(Starts to cry.) Oh that's...<b title="It was Rachel before">now me</b>. What, do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I are doing, we're doing really well right now.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might <b title='spoil, ruin'>wreck</b> it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, exactly.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
<s>The Delivery Room, Rachel is in bed as Joey enters.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_show">Wiki</a>]'>freak show</b> up here. (Notices she's wiping her eyes.) What's the matter?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What is it? Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really it's nothing. I'm just...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rach come on, what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I've just been thinking about how, my baby and I are gonna be all alone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What're you talking about alone? What about Ross?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, please, he'll be with this real family, the twins and little Ms. new boobs.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, how long was I watching that woman?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm just saying that you know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I guess so.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>Pretty</b> <b title='stupid'>dumb</b> huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you listen to me, listen to me...you are <b title='very strong "never"'>never ever</b> gonna be alone. Ok? I promise I won't let that happen.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey. Oh sweetie, what would I do without you?<br>
(They hug.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you don't have to worry about that ok?<br>
(Pause)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, honey could you grab me my other box of <b title='tissue - a piece of soft thin paper'>tissues</b>? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure.<br>
(He moves Ross's coat to get the tissues and the engagement ring box Mrs. Geller gave him falls out of the pocket it was inside. Joey goes to one knee, picks up the box, opens it, and sees that it's an engagement ring.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey.<br>
(He turns to face Rachel on one knee with the box open.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Ok.<br>
(Joey is <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>.)<br>
[Cut to Ross getting off an elevator carrying a <b title='a collection of flowers, cut and tied together in an attractive way'>bouquet</b> of flowers and walking down the hall to Rachel's room.]<br>

<i>Joey</i>Listen, I know the invitation says 6 o'clock, but does that mean you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start <b title='exactly'>right</b> at six?<br>
<i>Monica</i>The show?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right. Right. The wedding, <b title='I understand'>gotcha</b>. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Have you ever been to one of my weddings?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is, it's the same day as my <b title='↗nephew'>niece</b>'s <b title='christen - baptize a baby and officially give it a name'>christening</b> and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, the wedding, starts at six.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Ok, I totally hear you. Oh, how about this? I <b title='improvise simple accompaniment or variation of a tune'>vamp</b> a little <b title='=till, until'>'til</b> they get there?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You'll vamp?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah! You know, like warm up the crowd. Ask them where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a <b title='a priest in some Christian churches'>minister</b> and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one greater!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, please God, don't vamp.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Ok. Well maybe, maybe I'll talk to Chandler. Maybe he'd like to get married at 007 o'clock.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, all right, I will give you 10 extra minutes. 10! <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>That is it</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. All right.<br>
[Chandler comes out of the bedroom, wearing a ridiculous-looking tux.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, we're in luck. The tux fits perfectly.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler... That jacket is <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> too big.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh that's ok, the pants are way too small.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry sweetie. You, you cannot wear that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Now this means Ross's gonna be the only cool one. Something by the way I never thought I would say!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, take that thing off. You look like a fool. Now come on, come next door with me. I got some minister <b title='headdress - a covering worn on the head on special occasions'>headdresses</b> I want you to take a look at.<br>
[Chandler follows]
<s>The restaurant, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>How can you not remember us kissing?!<br>
<i>Melissa</i>I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the <b title='a deck or balcony that is screened and furnished for sleeping in the warmer months [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Porch">Wiki</a>]'>sleeping porch</b>! We couldn't stop <b title='giggle - laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way'>giggling</b>? And our coconuts kept knocking together?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't wanna make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.<br>
<i>Melissa</i>I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I <b title='pass out - become unconscious'>passed out</b> and you did <b title='things'>stuff</b> to me while I was sleeping.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! All right. Ok, fine. You don't have to admit it, 'cause I know that it happened.<br>
<i>Melissa</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No you have to admit it. We kissed, say it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel, it's ok. You don't have to do this. All right? I believe you. Ok, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you Phoebe.<br>
<i>Melissa</i>She didn't.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know.<br>
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as Ross enters carrying his tux around.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You just carry that around?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes. I find it to be something of a <b title='an interesting or unusual object that attracts attention and makes people start talking about it ↗subject, topic'>conversation piece</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Between you and...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? You know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.<br>
<i>Monica</i>A little tight? I could see <b title='balls, nuts, testicles'>double-oh</b> and <b title='penis'>seven</b> in those pants.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well that <b title='stink - used to say that sth is bad ↗suck'>stinks</b>. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Does that mean that you're not gonna wearing yours?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What- You kidding? It's Batman's tux!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(standing up) Let me <b title='put on a piece of clothing to see if it fits you or if it suits you'>try it on</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not getting in there.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(trying on the jacket) Ok. Holy double-<b title='vent - a thin straight opening at the bottom of the back or side of a jacket or coat ↗ventilate'>vented</b> comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What's this?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Um?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>An invitation for the <b title='a 1999 film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_First_Sight">Wiki</a>]'>At First Sight</b> <b title='the first public performance of a movie/play ↗debut'>premiere</b>? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some <b title='disparaging (criticizing) nickname for an effeminate (looking, behaving or sounding like a woman or a girl) male. ↗sissy, girlie, chick-flick'>tootie fruitie</b> love story where he played a blind guy!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The only superpower you have is a slightly <b title='heighten =intensify ↗strengthen'>heightened</b> sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for <b title='a very short period of time'>a sec</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>, I give up! Whatever you want you could have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the <b title='a holy table in a church or temple'>altar</b> and scream <b title="connected with a person's race ↗prejudice, racism, discrimination">racial</b> <b title='slur - an unfair criticism'>slurs</b>? I don't care!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> be a part of your special day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(defeated) Oh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. I will. Ohh! <b title='Look at'>Check out</b> what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He <b title='tilt - move, or make sth move, into a position with one side or end higher than the other'>tilts</b> it to the side of his head) is for party time.
<s>Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>It happened! <b title='used for emphasis'>I am telling you</b> it happened!<br>
<i>Melissa</i>Ok. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you (<b title='hail - call to sb in order to attract their attention ↗flag down'>hails</b> a cab) because umm, you know you <b title='get - make sb do sth'>got</b> me <b title='experience an odd, unusual, and sometimes uneasy sensation'>weird</b>.

(She's about to get in when...)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! Wait a minute! No, wait a minute! (She does so.) Ok? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Ok, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)<br>
<i>Melissa</i>My God! You love me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(shocked) What?<br>
<i>Melissa</i>Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>. I can still hear the coconuts knocking together I... (Phoebe is shocked.) I just didn't wanna tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and <b title='because of sth or as a result of sth'>now that</b> you have... (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='↗back off, recoil, retreat'>moving away</b>) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!<br>
<i>Melissa</i>Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (<b title='go in - make an approach'>Goes in</b> again.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(moves away again) I-I-I-I'm just... I'm just a good kisser!<br>
<i>Melissa</i>(suddenly frightened) Shut up!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry!<br>
<i>Melissa</i>(laughs) Oh you don't have to be (Laughs again) sorry. I'm... I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I love her. I don't, hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't... picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. <b title='used when you want to end a conversation or leave a place'>Anyway</b>, I gotta go. Eh... kiss goodbye? (Rachel stares at her <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>.) No? Ok. (Hurries into the cab and drives off.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was...<br>
(Suddenly, Phoebe leans in and kisses her on the lips!)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What the <b title='used when you are annoyed or surprised, or to emphasize sth'>hell</b> was that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Just wanted to see what all the <b title='unnecessary excitement, worry or activity'>fuss</b> was about.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I had better.

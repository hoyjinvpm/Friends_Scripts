<i>Ross</i>My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! How-how?! How could this happen?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."<br>

<i>Ross</i>Ok, well, then we-we'll call the company that sent her!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm <b title='miss - notice that you do not have sth any more'>missing</b> a ring!"<br>
<i>Ross</i>So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...<br>

<i>The Stripper</i>Ok, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.) Hey, Joey?<br>

<i>The Stripper</i>Hey what's he talking about?<br>
<i>Joey</i>There was a ring, in a box, on my <b title='a small table beside a bed'>nightstand</b>, after you left, it was gone!<br>
<i>The Stripper</i>You guys think I stole <b title='used to mean a person or thing, when you do not know or say exactly which'>some</b> ring?<br>

(Joey looks at Ross and smiles.) Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make <b title='$83,200 after-tax, in 1998'>$1,600 a week</b> doing what I do; any of you guys make that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
<s>Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do, since their plan with the stripper <b title='if a plan or action backfires, it has the opposite effect to the one you intended'>backfired</b> on them.</s>

<i>Rachel</i>I still don't get how you know when it's false labor.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, do you see any babies?<br>
<i>Monica</i>How do you feel?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I just, I know it's gonna be over soon. So-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But, isn't that a good thing? I mean, you said you were sick of this.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. It's just you know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, and-and you know, you know you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking <b title="a strong alcoholic drink originally from Mexico [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila'>Wiki</a>]">tequila</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Some moms do that.<br>

<i>Joey</i>If anything <b title='used to talk about sth that may possibly happen or be true'>should</b> happen to him...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.<br>
(With that we go into a little <b title='a scene in a film, play, book etc that shows sth that happened before that point in the story ↗clip'>flashback</b> about the guys' memories of the duck. The first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off.

Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it's Chandler <b title='shoo - used to tell an animal or a child to go away'>shooing</b> them out of the bathroom in the girls' apartment, Joey revealing their disco <b title='a very small space or room'>cubbyhole</b> in the entertainment center, then Chandler playing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_go_seek">Wiki</a>]'>Hide-and-Go-Seek</b> with them, and it's <b title='conclude - end, complete'>concluded</b> with various scenes with the duck flapping it's wings. And the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm so worried about him, you know?<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>(Coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a <b title='If you do a double-take when you see or hear sth, you hesitate for a moment before reacting to it because you wonder if you really saw or heard it.'>double take</b> realizing where it's been.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>H-h-h-how's the duck?<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little <b title='a short period of time'>bit</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, <b title="↗we're ok/good">that's all right</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally <b title='let sb down - disappoint sb ↗screw up, mess up'>let you down</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, <b title='tell sb that you know that what they have just said was not true'>come on</b>, it's not your fault.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, it is! You wouldn't 've lost the ring, right? you know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, you should.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, don't argue with me...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man. I want both you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, both you guys should be up <b title='the altar - a holy table or surface used in religious ceremonies'>there</b> with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good... (They all start getting <b title='↗choking'>emotional</b>.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh, mom gave it to me. She said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need....one. (Realizing) I really didn't need to tell you all that.<br>

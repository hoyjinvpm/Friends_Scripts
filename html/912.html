<i>Rachel</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Gavin, I, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an apology.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>For what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were <b title='feeling, or showing that one feels, that one is much more important than other people ↗snobbish, patronize, strut'>pompous</b> and <b title='behaving in an unpleasant or rude way because you think you are more important than other people'>arrogant</b> and <b title='very unpleasant ↗disgusting, outrageous'>obnoxious</b>...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I <b title='misjudge - form a wrong or unfair opinion about sb/sth'>misjudged</b> you.<br>
(Heather walks in)<br>
<i>Heather</i>Good morning!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, <b title='turn over a new leaf - begin again'>new leaf</b>, I am just really really happy... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait <b title='=til, until'>'til</b> it's finished.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I was giving you an apology and you were totally <b title='check out - look at'>checking her out</b>!<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh wow, you are really, you're really a <b title='sb who you dislike extremely ↗pervert, freak, psycho, maniac'>creep</b>.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass." (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I was just thinking you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your <b title='sb who has a lower position and less authority than sb else in an organization'>subordinate</b>.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>But it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That is totally different for two reasons. One, I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had, we had a deap meaningful relationship.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Huh. What's Tag's last name?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It was... (can't remember) oh my God. He didn't, he didn't, he didn't have a last name. It was just-just "Tag". You know, like-like <b title='an American singer and actress [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher">Wiki</a>]'>Cher</b>, or, you know, <b title='a religious leader, lawgiver, and prophet [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Wiki</a>] ↗Ten Commandments, Red Sea'>Moses</b>.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>But it was a deap meaningful relationship.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you know what, my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!<br>
<i>Gavin</i>It was Jones.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah well what're you, his boyfriend?

<i>Joey</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, I wish I had a nanny like you.<br>
<i>Molly</i>You mean, when you were a baby?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure.<br>
(Chandler is staring at Molly)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Would you stop staring at her?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I wasn't staring. I was <b title='leer - look at sb in an unpleasant way that shows that you think they are sexually attractive ↗lure'>leering</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kinda way.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's <b title='exactly'>right</b> there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Looks like Joey is doing <b title='satisfactory or reasonably good'>allright</b> with her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to <b title='move backwards'>back off</b> and let Joey get the girl for once.<br>
<i>Molly</i>(To Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the apartment.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I'll be uh home <b title='immediately'>right</b> after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you- wovyou dovyou...<br>
<i>Molly</i>Bye-bye.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Ross) They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk, it's not so good.<br>
<i>Molly</i>I think it's <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. (goes to leave)<br>
<i>Ross, Joey and Chandler</i>Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't <b title='try to attract sexually ↗hit on, come on to, flirt'>go after</b> her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, what, you-you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, it sounds about right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on, there are plenty of other women out there, ok? Just-just forget about her, ok? Just, she's <b title='If a place is off limits to sb, they are not allowed to go there'>off limits</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, man, why did you have to go and say that for? <b title='because of sth, as a result of sth'>Now that</b> you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What're you, a child?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's true; he's like a little boy. Like Ben! Just think of him as a really, really, really <b title='sexually excited'>horny</b> Ben.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! Look, Joey, come on, now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Does he?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe he's-he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on me?<br>

(Molly gets up and walks away)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>So what, what do you think you're gonna do, huh? have sex with her <b title='exactly'>right</b> here on my couch?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think, that I'm just gonna sleep with her <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> <b title='blow off - ignore'>blow her off</b>? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.<br>
(pause)<br>
<i>Ross and Chandler</i><b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>Come on</b>! Joe!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. (admits)<br>
(knock on door, Ross opens, it's a woman)<br>
<i>Woman</i>Hi, is Molly here?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ah, yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?<br>
<i>Molly</i>(goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok... (they leave the room, long pause) Uh, well, Joey, I, I guess we have no problem.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the <b title='↗gay, homosexual, heterosexual, come out (of the closet)'>lesbian</b>!

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, ok, you start preparing the <b title='Infant formula is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usu prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water).

<i>Mike</i>Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives <b title='have sth as a main subject or purpose ↗revolver, revolution, orbit, spin'>revolve</b> around their rats?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they <b title='have sex to produce babies'>mate</b> and there are hundreds of them?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah, uh, not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No. (opens the box) Really? Oh my God, get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens, esp sth unpleasant'>what if</b>, what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like... (starts counting with her fingers) That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. All right, so we should just <b title='give away - give sth to sb because you do not want or need it for yourself ↗give up'>give them away</b>. But to nice families, with-with children, and reduced fat <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Wheat-Thins-Box-Small.jpg/180px-Wheat-Thins-Box-Small.jpg"> a popular baked snack cracker found in North America, distributed by Nabisco [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Thins">Wiki</a>]'>Wheat Thins</b>. Those were Bob's favorites.<br>
<i>Mike</i>It's gonna be ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You must think I'm crazy.<br>
<i>Mike</i>No, I think you're sweet.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good. It's just-just so hard, it's hard for me to... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
<s>Rachel's party, Rachel is on the balcony, Monica goes there also.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="used to say 'no' in a forceful way ↗not really">No way</b>! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything <b title='=all right'>alright</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I just get a little <b title='sad. also "bummed out"'>bummed</b> when my birthday's over.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That <b title='sb who is stupid or who does things that annoy or hurt other people'>jerk</b> Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Mmm hmm.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Yeah, I hate him. (comes in to the balcony)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, <b title='impossible'>no way</b> to <b title='return to a normal state'>recover</b>. No.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uhh.<br>
(Monica goes back inside)<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Fun party.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it was, and you would've seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch)... 9:30? God! Oh, this party was <b title='boring/not very good'>lame</b>...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(from inside) Again, you're welcome.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Look, I'll just give you this and go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you bought me a present! Why?<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a <b title='except Rachel, Monica, and Gavin'>fourth or fifth</b> person. Ok, I... I got you the present to <b title='do sth to show that you are sorry for doing sth that upset or annoyed sb ↗make up to'>make up for</b> being such a jerk to you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). "From Gavin."<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I really mean it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>You don't mind? Let me. (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I'm not sure.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I do have feelings for you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You do?<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you... (he kisses her) and you do that... (they kiss again)<br>
(cut to Ross from his appartment, holding baby toys and is shocked to see them kissing)

<i>Chandler</i>There's got to be a way!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Easy there <b title='a character in Star Trek [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Kirk">Wiki</a>]'>Captain Kirk</b>. Oh, do you have a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Bobby_pin.jpg/220px-Bobby_pin.jpg"> ↗hairpin'>bobby pin</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Then why do you <b title='trick, mislead'>throw</b> like one?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure. "Monica."<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, how's the <b title='hideous - extremely ugly or bad'>hideously</b> inappropriate <b title='a strong but temporary attraction for sb'>crush</b> on Rachel <b title='come - reach a particular level or place'>coming</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself <b title='↗any minute now'>any day now</b>. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>, you know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, <b title='help out - help'>helping out</b> with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels <b title='leave out - to not include sb/sth'>left out</b>. You know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's a good idea.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda <b title='sad'>bummed</b> huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I just...I feel terrible.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's not your fault. What're you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? You know? You're doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for <b title='harbor - keep bad thoughts, fears, or hopes in your mind for a long time'>harboring</b> an <b title='so important or interesting to you that you cannot think of anything else ↗overwhelming'>all-consuming</b> love for the woman who's carrying his baby.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, there is that.<br>
(Chandler loses his card behind the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?

<i>Monica</i>I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no, I-I got that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Ok well you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I mean 500.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>600.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? (Laughs.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and it really <b title='freak sb out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked me out</b>! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just <b title='spur - encourage'>spurred</b> you on.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? There's nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oh God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b> guy is watching closely.) (To him) What're you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, that's why Alexandra wears <b title='earplug - a small piece of rubber that you put inside your ear to keep out noise or water'>earplugs</b> when she gives me a massage. It's not because she <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hates</b> <b title='an Irish singer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enya">Wiki</a>]'>Enya</b>! Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm-I'm never gonna get massaged again!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well not clients, lovers. Let's just you know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll <b title='deal with problems'>work through</b> it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Great! Ok, now, just, if you'll just <b title='used to tell sb politely that you are leaving'>excuse me</b>. (To the guy) So, did you hear something you liked?

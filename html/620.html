<i>Joey</i>I said name one!

<i>Monica</i>Oh, stop <b title='blame yourself too much for sth'>beating yourself up</b>! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there?

<i>Monica</i>You know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Ok...<br>

[We then go into another set of flashbacks of famous fights. The first is the second breakup of Ross and Rachel from '<a href="401.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/401.html">401</a>'.]<br>

<i>Monica</i>You had no right to go out with him.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That is the most ridiculous...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I did not sell you out.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Would you let me talk. [<b title='flick - move or hit sth with a short sudden movement'>flicks</b> Monica on the forehead]<br>

[Chandler's. He's playing foosball by himself.]<br>
[Joey's. Playing ping pong by himself.]<br>
[Chandler is sitting in front of a window while it's raining outside. We see Joey through a rainy window. The camera <b title='↗fade in'>zooms out</b> to show it's just his tabletop water sculpture.]

<i>Chandler</i>Joey? Got you the Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damn it! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message, I think. (Listens) He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! (Listens) Well no, obviously not for the actor who was <b title='If an animal mauls sb, it attacks them and injures them with its teeth or claws'>mauled</b> by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he's writing) Ok, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey is entering to find Chandler waiting patiently for him.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Please tell me you got the message!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What message?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! It's 6 o'clock!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffee house! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You hug me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right!<br>
[What follows is the final set of flashbacks that feature a whole lot of loving between Chandler and Joey. There's no words, just hugs and even the kiss from '<a href="110.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/110.html">110</a>'.

<i>Joey</i>Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I'll just have to carry you.<br>
(Suddenly Ross jumps up from behind the counter armed with a plastic gun. By the way, he's overacting too.)<br>

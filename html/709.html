<i>Chandler</i>(laughs) 4:00 A.M.<br>
<i>Gary</i>So, can I get some candy?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us. He can hear me can't he?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, listen I am sorry, but I-I'll put some out <b title='at the earliest time in the day'>first thing</b> in the morning.<br>

<i>Tag</i>No! It was marked <b title='secret, often in a formal, business or military situation'>confidential</b>, I just sent it down to Human Resources.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(worried) Ok please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!<br>
<i>Tag</i>A joke they would <b title='If you appreciate sth, you like it because you recognize its good qualities.'>appreciate</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm thinking, no.<br>
<i>Tag</i>What did you say?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Umm, I said that I-I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your <b title='=tiny'>teeny</b>-tiny <b title='↗arse, ass, bottom, buttock, butt, rear, posterior, stern, tush, tushy'>tushie</b>.<br>

<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Joey, Monica, Ross, and Chandler are watching Phoebe polish the daisies on her bike outside.</s>

<i>Joey</i>Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? <b title='almost cried ≠ actually cried'>Almost cried</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, yeah! I saw her <b title='↗walk dog'>walking</b> it down the street <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b>. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I saw her this morning walking it by the park.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?<br>
[Cut to outside, they're going to talk to Phoebe about walking the bike.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Pheebs?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, uh-huh so much!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Of course!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (The <b title='group of people'>gang</b> giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the <b title='a frame or shelf that has bars or hooks on which you can put things'>rack</b>, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is making candy while Chandler and Rachel are taste testing and Joey is on the couch <b title='doodle - draw lines, shapes etc'>doodling</b>.</s>
<i>Monica</i>See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to having <b title='affair - a sexual relationship between two people ↗adultery'>affairs</b>. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(with his mouth full) What happened? I'm just eating candy.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That sketch you mentioned? Might it've looked a little something like this? (He shows her what he's been drawing.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! Joey!<br>

<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? (Points to her new sign.) Rules are rules.<br>
<i>The Woman</i>Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!<br>

<i>Joey</i>(watching the discussion) Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(still talking to the woman) All right, I'll do it <b title='used for emphasizing that this is the only time'>just this once</b>! But you can't tell anybody!<br>
<i>The Woman</i>(<b title='exasperated - very annoyed and upset ↗desperate'>exasperatedly</b>) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!<br>
<i>Joey and Chandler</i>Yeah, that's her.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Ok, maybe before we start we should just get another one.

<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, you can't <b title='escape ↗flee, chicken out, get cold feet'>get out of</b> this! Ok? You have to learn how to ride a bike!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Oh! Oh, no! You swore!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...<br>

[Cut to Phoebe's room, Phoebe has put her helmet on one of her teddy bears and is playing around with it. Ross knocks and <b title='poke - appear or stretch out from behind or through sth ↗stick'>pokes</b> his head in the door.]<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>I could've been killed I hope you know!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close, Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I would love to but... the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that <b title='↗doubtful, dubious, quizzical, questionable'>suspiciously</b> looks like a bike.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>What?! (Ross rings the bell.) <b title='used to show that you are very surprised or angry'>What the hell</b>?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, you know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! Why?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Ok, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be <b title='↗ride_rode_ridden'>ridden</b> and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike, is dying.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. If you care enough to <b title='invent'>make up</b> that <b title='a large quantity of sth'>load</b> of <b title='rubbish'>crap</b>, ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You're making the bike very happy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='sarcastic - using sarcasm (a way of using words that are the opposite of what you mean in order to be unpleasant to sb or to make fun of them)'>sarcastically</b>) Ok Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don't die!
<s>Rachel's office, Tag and her are planning how to get the review back.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. <b title='used to introduce a command, suggestiion, request etc'>Now</b>, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.<br>
<i>Tag</i>That's <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> sad.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, well Betty's kinda <b title='boring or not deserving any respect'>sad</b>. Which is why I believe I can <b title='persuade sb to do sth or go somewhere by offering them sth ↗distract, seduce'>lure</b> her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her, you go in the office.<br>
<i>Tag</i><b title='(I) got it - I understand'>Got it</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Let's <b title='go'>roll</b>!<br>
(They start towards the door but are stopped when Mr. Zelner enters.)<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(worried and shocked) Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner, for you, anything- a minute. Ok. Great. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to <b title='take or show sb where they should go'>usher</b> Tag out.)<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Uh actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some, chocolates? (Holds up the box.)<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. (Rachel <b title='glance - quickly look'>glances</b> at Tag to say, "See?") So I <b title='past tense /red/'>read</b> your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag <b title='sweet + cheeks'>Sweetcheeks</b> Jones. Something going on with you two?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) Oh my God. Can-can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what wo-would happen exactly.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Well, I'd be forced to <b title='place sth in a file'>file</b> a report. I'd have to <b title='go to sb for information or advice'>consult</b> with the legal department, and your future at the company would be <b title='in a dangerous position or situation and likely to be lost or harmed'>in jeopardy</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh no-no-no...<br>
<i>Tag</i>(interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>You wrote that you have a cute tushie?<br>
<i>Tag</i>(pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>It's kind of a risky joke, Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figure out</b> what this is?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You're looking at it upside down-you know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn't matter.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Nah, don't worry about it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, you could've lost your job.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you! You're great! (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Tag</i>You know what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Tag</i>I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.<br>
<i>Tag</i>I'm sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)

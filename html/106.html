<i>Joey</i>Hi, um- I'm here to see (reading the card) Estelle Leonard.<br>
<i>Estelle</i>Just a moment let me see if she's in. (she turns her back to Joey and then turns right back around). Hello.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're Estelle Leonard?<br>
<i>Estelle</i>I know, I know you weren't expecting some one so fantastically beautiful. (pops open a cup with circle rack of cigarettes, and takes one.)

<i>Estelle</i>Why not?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, what I meant...<br>
<i>Estelle</i>(interrupts) You don't mind if I eat while we talk, do you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no.<br>
<i>Estelle</i>(she takes a bite of her sandwich and takes another smoke) So... Joey, sweetheart let me ask you a question. Did you ever see the movie <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepless_In_Seattle">Wiki</a>]'>Sleepless In Seattle</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Wow! Do you represent those actors?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, looks like a boat.<br>
<i>Ross</i>A boat! Ha!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, right there in front of the Statue of Liberty.

<i>All</i>Oh, yeah, right, right.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How was your <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>, 'Chand-lrr'?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel">Wiki</a>]'>Israeli</b> army...<br>
(A <b title="a scene in a film, play, book etc that shows sth that happened before that point in the story">flashback</b> of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk)<br>

<i>Aurora</i>My husband.<br>
<i>All</i>Ooooohhh.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, so you're <b title='if sb is widowed, their husband or wife dies'>widowed</b>? ...Hopefully?<br>

<i>Aurora</i>Don't worry. I imagine he'd be ok with you because really, he's ok with Ethan.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?<br>
<i>Aurora</i>Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.<br>
<i>All</i>What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?<br>
<i>Aurora</i>I suppose mainly sexual.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>...Hm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. I'm sorry it didn't <b title="prove effective or successful">work out</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Didn't YOU listen to the story? I mean, this is <b title="strange and slightly unpleasant">twisted</b>! How could you get involved with a woman like this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good <b title='things'>stuff</b>: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So you guys don't mind <b title='↗ask out, date, engagement'>going out</b> with someone else who's going out with someone else?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I couldn't do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="used to show approval">Good for you</b>, Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, one time I went out with a guy who had just <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> divorced. And it was really hard. His kids liked me better than him.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, what<b title='does'>'s</b> this have to do with Chandler’s thing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, nothing. But I didn’t have anything on that topic. (small pause) So I went another way.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.) (Chandler enters with the phone.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a couple of things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you got the whole night, huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, you know... (He starts to <b title='take sth from a place'>raid</b> the <b title='↗freezer, refrigerator'>fridge</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, do I sense a little bit of <b title="a feeling of anger because sth has happened that you think is unfair =bitterness">resentment</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. Ok?

<i>Director</i>Ok, everybody ready?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. Uhm I mean, listen, I know this is just a first step but I hoped someday- <br>
<i>Director</i>(Interrupts) Lose the <b title="=bathrobe">robe</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right. Ok. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) Ok, and the robe is lost.<br>
<i>Director</i>Ok, everybody, we'd like to get this in one <b title='an occasion when a film scene, song, action etc is recorded'>take</b>, please.

<i>Joey</i>Oh. Well, the way I <b title='understand'>see</b> it, the guy's upset here, you know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.<br>
<i>Director</i>I think his butt would like to get this <b title='the view of sth in a film or TV program that is produced by having the camera in a particular position'>shot</b> before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I was <b title='go for - choose'>going for</b> quiet <b title='the feeling that you have when you are in such a bad situation that you will try anything to change it'>desperation</b>. If you have to ask.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>God, I love these fingers.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look how happy they are.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>(moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She starts to get up.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go, don't go, don't go... (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)<br>
<i>Aurora</i>Ok... Oh no, I have to.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>(getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>It's not Rick.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ethan? He <b title='get to - have the opportunity to'>got to</b> spend the whole day with you!<br>
<i>Aurora</i>No, it's-it's Andrew.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question: but- And Andrew is?<br>
<i>Aurora</i>He's... new.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh so what you're saying is you're not completely <b title="feel satisfied">fulfilled</b> by Rick, Ethan, and myself?<br>
<i>Aurora</i>No, that's not exactly what I was..<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you know, most women would <b title="want sth so much that you will do almost anything to get it or do it">kill for</b> three guys like us.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>So what'd you want?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>You have me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no, just you.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>What'd you mean?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="stop having">Lose</b> the other guys.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>Like... all of them?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Come on, we're great together, why not?<br>
<i>Aurora</i>Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without <b title='feel obligated to sb - feel that you owe sb sth because of what they have done for you'>feeling obligated to</b> one another... up till tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, you know? I mean, one guy's saying 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the guy who <b title="if a feeling wells or wells up in you, you start to feel it strongly">wells up</b> every time that <b title='How the Grinch Stole Christmas! is a Christmas story witten by Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel...

<i>Aurora</i>So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>Which one?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The second guy.<br>
<i>Aurora</i>(gets up to leave) I see. Well, call me if you change your mind. (She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry, the first guy <b title='be in charge of, manage'>runs</b> the lips. (She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler. Joey is absent.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this-this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, <b title="impossible to achieve or obtain">unattainable</b>... Tell me why you did this again? (Joey enters.)<br>
<i>All</i>Hey! Big star!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, wait a minute, aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="no">Nope</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>It felt like a 'big guy' moment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I got fired.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to <b title="recognize difference">tell</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>My mom will.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Something so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> and...<b title='making you feel worried/upset'>disturbing</b> about that.<br>

And I finally get my <b title="chance, opportunity">shot</b>, and I <b title="fail to take advantage of an opportunity by doing or saying sth wrong">blow it</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute, maybe this wasn't your shot.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I-I think when it's your shot, you know, you-you know it's your shot. Did... Did it... feel like your shot?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hard to tell, I was naked.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I don't think this was your shot. I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! And, you've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and <b title='say'>go</b> 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'<br>
<i>Joey</i>You think? That's so nice! (They hug.) (Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.<br>
<i>All</i>Night. Good night, Monica.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, Mon, you-you're gonna leave your shoes out here?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or, not... Whenever. (Goes to her room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>She is a kook.

<i>Monica</i>(<b title="hum - sing a tune by making a continuous sound with your lips closed">hums</b> for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them... But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! Oh, I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)

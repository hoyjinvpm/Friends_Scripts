<i>Monica</i>No. While you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!<br>

<i>Joey</i>(returning from a <b title='delicatessen (a shop or part of a shop that sells food such as cheese and cold meat)'>deli</b>) Ok, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!<br>
<i>Gary</i>Hey Joe, does it have meatballs on it?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Your tax dollars?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, ok.<br>
[Time lapse, they're still on the ride-along and Joey is just <b title='sniff - smell sth by taking air in through your nose'>sniffing</b> his sandwich.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> smell good.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ohh! Oh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

(Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall <b title='an object which is fixed to a wall to hold electric lights or candles'>sconce</b> and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(does Monica's) I know!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-what?! We can't do that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We have to! I mean <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> Ross hears that, and he calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, <b title='unreasonably anxious or afraid'>neurotic</b>, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He-he should not get back together with her. I mean I know that, you know that, even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm his sister, ok? And I love him! I don't wanna see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him- help, him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='She thinks Monica, a controlling freak, is the one who needs help'>I don't think he's the one who needs help</b>.<br>
(They both sit down.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, she's obviously unstable, ok? I mean she's thinking about <b title='↗abandon, desert, elope, run/walk out on'>running out</b> on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Ok, fine! But let me- look at the position she's putting him in! And what's he gonna do? Like- Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in <b title='a strong feeling of dislike, annoyance, or disapproval'>disgust</b>.) Ok, fine, all right, but that's you know, that was different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what, this is obviously some <b title='strange and slightly unpleasant or cruel'>twisted</b> joke she's trying to play on him.<br>

<i>Gary</i>Ok, he sees us. Don't move. And don't look at him.<br>
(They all turn and look away. Suddenly a loud bang sounds out and in slow motion Joey slowly throws his body over Ross. Gary is shocked at what he sees while Chandler is obviously hurt.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Look, if you're gonna be totally <b title='rational thoughts, decisions etc are based on reasons rather than emotions ↗illoogical'>rational</b> about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just, I don't wanna be a part of it.<br>
(The phone rings.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday <b title='in the best or most complete way'>to the fullest</b>. Love yourself, ok? Ok. Oh, and-and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>) Wow, really?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I... I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. You know? I-I wanna experience every moment. I wanna seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because a car backfired?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(stares at her <b title='momentarily'>briefly</b>) Ok, why are you here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You talked to her?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. I mean, there's some- (pause) something wrong with your machine.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, ok, what-what did she say?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, uh, something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Thank you! Thank you! Because- all right. I'm gonna <b title='used as an intensifier when joined by and to a coordinate verb'>go</b> <b title='move quickly and suddenly'>scoot</b> tell Monica that I was right. Because you know what? She didn't want- <b title='↗never mind, forget it'>not important</b>. <b title='main meaning/idea'>Point</b> is, I was right. Your decision. Ok? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, no, that's not the right decision. That's not right, that's not, no Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you <b title='extremely unhappy'>miserable</b>! Ok, Ross, I mean, do you really wanna get back into that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, look, yesterday I wouldn't've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> mean something, right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was <b title='almost not, hardly'>barely</b> an experience!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You weren't there! Ok, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! You know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, you know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok I mean, look-look today. I mean you escaped (pause) (not believing it) death, you know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, th-<b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>there you go</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah-ah. Yeah. Maybe today is just, <b title='when you come extremely close to a dangerous or unpleasant situation or only just manage to avoid it =close shave'>close call</b> day.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughing) Close call day.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, honey <b title='↗sure, not at all, my pleasure'>no problem</b>. Ok. (Gets up.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh?<br>
(Ross hits the playback button.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. (She heads for the door again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I want my money back.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?<br>
(Ross is <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>.)
<s>Central Perk, everyone is there.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at <b title='real, not pretended'>for real</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I wonder how I'd react under fire, you know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like if I was in a war or something.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would <b title='have the qualities that are necessary for a particular job etc'>make</b> a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would <b title='become'>make</b> general before any of you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Before or after you were shot by your own <b title='soldiers ↗trooper, infantry'>troops</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the <b title='a small hole which soldiers dig as a shelter from the enemy and from which they can shoot ↗trench'>foxhole</b> protecting all of us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, if the foxhole was <b title='line - form a layer over the inner surface of sth'>lined</b> with sandwiches.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well you all know that I'm a <b title='sb who believes in pacifism (the belief that war and violence are always wrong)'>pacifist</b> so I'm not interested in war, in any way. (Gets up) But you know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.<br>
(Joey gets all happy with himself, while the rest of the gang is less than <b title='enthuse - show great admiration or interest for sb/sth'>enthused</b>.)<br>

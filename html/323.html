<i>Joey</i>So-so it's just skin?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, no. He said it's skin-like.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. So it's not skin.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well it's in the skin family. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was <b title='slow and unwilling'>reluctant</b> to remove it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, well you know what? You should go to my guy, <b title='because'>'cause</b> when I went in there with my third nipple. He just <b title='lop - chop'>lopped</b> it <b title='immediately'>right</b> off. You know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.<br>
<i>Ross</i>At least they knew what yours was. You know, yours had a name.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! You know, they'd call it, the Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>Sarcastic</b>) Yeah, that'd be cool!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, and when Pete gets down on his knee and pulls out that pumpkin-sized diamond ring...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. I gotta go. I have to break up with Vince.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I like Vince a lot, you know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, you know? And <b title='later in the future, not immediately ↗long-term'>in the long run</b>, I think sensitive it's-s-s better than having just like a really, really, really nice (Pause) body.

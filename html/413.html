<s>A Theatre, Chandler and Ross are there to watch the <b title='the first public performance of a play or a movie ↗debut'>premiere</b> of Kathy's play.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> have sex with the star of the play!<br>
<i>Ross</i>People can hear you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know!!<br>
(The play starts.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh.<br>
(Onstage there's a knock on the door and Kathy opens it. We don't see what's going on, only hear it.)<br>
<i>Kathy's Co-Star</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That is one <b title='↗handsome, gorgeous'>good looking</b> man!<br>

<i>Kathy's Co-Star</i>Sooo, you've been doing this long?<br>
<i>Kathy</i>No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.<br>
(Ross and Chandler have <b title='very shocked or upset'>stunned</b> looks on their faces as Kathy and her co-star start <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b>.)<br>
<i>Kathy's Co-Star</i>Oh yeah! Ooh, that's nice. (They start making out harder.)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>!<br>
<i>Kathy's Co-Star</i>Is that an expensive <b title='a shirt for women [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blouse">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Dirndl-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dirndl.jpg/220px-Dirndl.jpg">'>blouse</b>?<br>
<i>Kathy</i>If you want it to be.<br>
(Kathy's co-star rips her blouse off and buttons go flying into the audience, and one hits Ross. Chandler's <b title='More common ways to phrase this idiom are "Jaws were on the floor" or "Their jaws dropped to the floor," both of which are hyperbole that mean their mouths were opened so wide in surprise that their jaws were on the floor.

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have like your old blouses and dresses from high school?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it's just that <b title='designed or provided for women who are pregnant or who have just had a baby'>maternity</b> clothes are so expensive.<br>
(Rachel enters)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, Rach! I made a <b title='↗heap, stack'>pile</b> of your <b title='things'>stuff</b> on this side of the room. If you could just...(Rachel <b title='make short sounds or say a few words in a rough voice, when you do not want to talk'>grunts</b> and throws her <b title='purse - handbag'>purses</b> at it)...throw your purses at it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomingdale%27s">Wiki</a>]'>Bloomingdale's</b> <b title='eliminate - get rid of'>eliminated</b> my department. (Phoebe <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, are you <b title='↗fire, quit, lay off, employ'>out of job</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, but they <b title='stick - put without much care'>stuck</b> me in personal shopping. Which is such a huge step down!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with <b title='rude and unfriendly, because you think you are better than other people'>snooty</b> rich people and tell them what to buy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That sounds great!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Entering) Hey! (Goes to the <b title='↗freezer, refrigerator'>fridge</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat our food anymore, that-that <b title='an occupation or other source of income that requires little effort while yielding considerable profit.'>gravy train</b> had ended.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Holding a turkey leg) There's <b title=' sauce made from the juices of cooked meat mixed with flour'>gravy</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>If you have the big apartment you then have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be <b title='stock - fill a place with things'>stocked</b>, ok, that's your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)<br>
(Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I think I left a <b title='a small round cake, often in the form of a ring'>donut</b> up here.
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey are already there.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh! How was Kathy's play?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, Kathy gets half-naked and <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mock, mimic'>simulates</b> sex with a real good looking guy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, it's like someone <b title='You can use literally to emphasize a statement.'>literally</b> wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's a good idea for a business!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm totally <b title='in trouble or in a bad situation'>screwed</b>. Ok, they are <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be <b title='referring to serious passion or emotions'>hot and heavy</b> on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their little <b title='all the people who perform in a play, film etc'>cast</b> parties and he's gonna try to <b title='deliberately say or do things that make sb appear less impressive or less important ↗degenerate, sabotage'>undermine</b> me. You know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll <b title='say'>go</b>, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Ross) That-that is a good <b title='clever method'>trick</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler, look, they're actors. They're there to do a job, just <b title='because'>'cause</b> they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sarandon">Wiki</a>]'>Susan Sarandon</b> and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Robbins">Wiki</a>]'>Tim Robbins</b>, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.<br>

<i>Ross</i>They're not a couple!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh-ok, I <b title='understand'>get</b> the game now.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All these people were in movies together. It's much different with plays.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You guys were just in acting class together and she slept with you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Acting class is a lot more like a movie than a play. Ok look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well ok, so then you're fine. Look, the rule is, when two actors are actually <b title='do it - have sex'>doing it</b> offstage then all the sexual tension between them is gone. Ok? So <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had <b title='The chemistry between a man and a woman can be described as either love at first sight or sb that who has grown on you [<a href="http://www.ask.com/question/chemistry-between-a-man-and-a-woman">link</a>]'>chemistry</b> on stage?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So uh, <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>, you're gonna go see the play with me tonight?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I know but...<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no-no, Oh I'm there.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Mon! Want some <b title='pancake - a thin flat round cake made from flour, milk, and eggs, that has been cooked in a flat pan and is eaten hot [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Neil%27s_blueberry_pancakes-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Neil%27s_blueberry_pancakes.jpg/220px-Neil%27s_blueberry_pancakes.jpg">'>pancakes</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You made pancakes?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yep! Grab a plate.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no, stay <b title='exactly'>right</b> there. (Monica stops and Joey <b title='flip - move sth with a quick sudden movement ↗toss'>flips</b> her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Getting closer.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, ok, but don't worry, because we also have <b title='cereal - a breakfast food made from grain and usually eaten with milk'>cereals</b>, <b title='muffin - a small sweet cake that often contains fruit'>muffins</b>, <b title='waffle - a flat cake that has deep square marks on both sides'>waffles</b>, and, jams, <b title='jelly - a sweet sticky food that is made from boiled fruit juice and sugar and is often spread on bread'>jellies</b>, and <b title='marmalade - a jam made from fruit such as oranges, lemons or grapefruit, usu eaten at breakfast [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmalade">Wiki</a>] <img src="200px-Homemade_marmalade,_England-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Homemade_marmalade%2C_England.jpg/200px-Homemade_marmalade%2C_England.jpg"> ↗lemonade, grenade'>marmalades</b>.

<i>Rachel</i>So, I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not <b title='ask out - ask sb to go to a film, a restaurant etc with you ↗hit on, go out, see, date, move in, dump, break up, get over'>asked me out</b>. Just so <b title='making you feel annoyed, upset, or impatient'>frustrating</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why don't you ask him out?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah, <b title='I agree ↗completely, entirely, wholly, absolutely'>totally</b>! That's such a <b title='sth that makes you feel excited, esp sexually'>turn-on</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? It doesn't seem desperate?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>He just got a divorce right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hmm-mmm.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So he's probably really nervous around women, you know? Maybe, you just need to make the first <b title='action'>move</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Shocked) You've never asked a guy out?!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. Have you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't even know how I would <b title='start to do ↗pick-up line'>go about</b> it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-oh-oh-oh, what I do it is, I look a woman up and down and then I say, "Hey, how you doing?"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='used to ask sb to stop behaving badly'>please</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doing?<br>
(Phoebe looks at him, and then <b title='giggle - laugh quickly, quietly, and in a high voice, because sth is funny or because you are nervous or embarrassed ↗smirk'>giggles</b> and looks away.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna <b title='call up - call ↗hang up, help out'>call him up</b>, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practicing) How you doing? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was just wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we - (Listens) the <b title="driver's license">license</b>? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so, ok, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You've done that a thousand times?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I've never done that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, God, I just <b title='get - become'>got</b> so nervous that he was gonna say no.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> give him something that he can't say no to. Like uh, <b title='a professional basketball team based in New York City, New York. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knicks">Wiki</a>]'>Knicks</b> tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?! You think that will work?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?<br>
(We hear a noise coming from Monica and Rachel's apartment.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What <b title='used for emphasizing a question ↗hell, shoot, shit, freaking, flinging-flanging, fucking'>the heck</b> is that?<br>
(They go open the door and reveal Monica being spun around on the floor polisher and getting the cord wrapped around her legs.)<br>
<s>Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Did she call?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, maybe I should call her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!<br>
<i>Ross</i>He's right, what she did was unforgivable.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, yeah, but you know, what-<b title='asking what would happen in a particular situation'>what if</b> I was wrong?<br>
<i>Ross</i>How might you be wrong?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well you know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dude, tell me she actually told you this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. <b title='say or show that what sb is saying is true'>Back me up</b> here, Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's all you're basing this on?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's not backing me up! Look, you said, you know, with the offstage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa-hold on, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't <b title='happen or develop in a particular way ↗work out'>pan out</b>. <b title=' the nickname given to the conclusion reached by the Warren Commission that U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by a single gunman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_gunman">Wiki</a>]'>Lone gunman</b>. Communism. Geometry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!!

<i>Rachel</i>Uh. Would you like to go to a basketball game with? No-no. (Tries again.) You know, it's funny, basketball, because I <b title='if you happen to do sth, you do it by chance'>happen to</b> have tickets to the... Ok (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knick- (Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is <b title='sb who is available does not have a wife, boyfriend etc ↗MBA (Married But Available), eligible bachelor'>available</b>, I think you look great!<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Huh. (She starts brushing the <b title='small pieces of thread or wool that come off cloth or clothes ↗fluff'>lint</b> off and <b title='check out - look at'>checking him out</b> in the mirror.) Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yep. Oh, yeah, you look great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?<br>
<i>Joshua</i>I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I-I think I'm gonna wear it home.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Great.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>All right, well thank you so much, for all your help.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title="↗you're welcome, not at all, no problem">Sure</b>.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Well, I guess uh, I guess <b title='this is the end. [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091128133507AAuZmSu">Yahoo Answer</a>]'>this is it</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a <b title='sth you say or do in order to thank sb'>thank-you</b> for this week.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Wow! That would be great.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Yeah, that would be <b title='excellent, wonderful'>fantastic</b>! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)<br>
<i>Mr. Waltham</i>Good morning.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Hi!<br>
(Mr. Waltham admires Joshua's butt as he leaves.)
<s>Kathy's apartment, Chandler is knocking on the door.</s>
<i>Kathy</i>(Opening the door) Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. You know? I know I acted like the biggest <b title='↗imbecile, moron, retarded'>idiot</b> in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Oh wow. I really wish you<b title='had'>'d</b> called me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but you know I-I think this is a good thing. You know? 'Cause we've had our first <b title='argument'>fight</b>, and now we can <b title='start taking action, esp in order to achieve sth or deal with a problem'>move on</b>. You know, I mean I know for me - (Notices a pair of men's pants on the chair.) Nick's pants?<br>
<i>Kathy</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!

Ross and Phoebe are watching.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, for next time, what do you say?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not two tickets, I have an extra ticket.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So the first time you asked a guy out, he-he <b title='turn down - refuse an offer, request, or invitation'>turned you down</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>, I'm just not on it!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Entering) Ok, it's ready. <b title='used to tell sb to hurry'>Come on</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's ready?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Just come.<br>
(They all go over to her apartment.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! Monica!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Heey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is beautiful!<br>
(She has cleaned it, completely redecorated it, removed the carpet, and polished the floor.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh did you - what did you - did you work for two days <b title='happening one after the other in a series ↗in tow'>straight</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='almost completely'>Pretty much</b>. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know, looks the same.<br>

(Chandler returns.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>How'd it <b title='happen'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh good!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She is now.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What're you saying?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! You know? I mean you think you know a person and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, in his rock hard <b title='the large muscles in your chest =pectorals ↗abs'>pecs</b>, and his giant man nipples! I hate him, and I hate her! I don't hate her, I, love her. This is all my fault really.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How? How is your fault?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because, ahh! I-I should've called! You know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, does not <b title='be a good and acceptable reason for sth ↗make sense'>justify</b> her sleeping with someone.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...<br>
(They all turn and <b title='↗stare, gaze, glimpse, glance'>glare</b> at him.)

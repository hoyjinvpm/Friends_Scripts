<i>Joey</i>Ah, Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, oh if you want, I could <b title='lend ↗borrow'>loan</b> you some money?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah. The pay is <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> good and you could do it for as long as you need.<br>

<i>Joey</i>She sure does. Why-why does she have a pink bow <b title='tape - fasten sth with sticky tape'>taped</b> to her head?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car <b title='a wire or metal pole/rod used for receiving or sending radio and signals'>antenna</b>!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>How long was I in there? (Points to the bathroom)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Let us start with the 'A's. Advertising.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well don't you wanna look at the rest?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising <b title='make sense - be reasonable/sensible ↗logical'>makes perfect sense</b>. Sorry you had to waste all this time, <b title='however'>though</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> use my <b title='a machine that destroys documents by cutting them into long thin pieces'>shredder</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard could it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "<b title='cracker - a thin flat crisp biscuit, esp one eaten with cheese'>Crackers</b>. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a watermelon in your mouth?"<br>
<i>Monica</i>I got one. "Socks. Because your <b title='a group of people who are related to each other'>family</b>'s feet deserve the best."<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey? Leave it to the <b title='pro - professional ≠amateur ↗rookie, amateur, veteran'>pros</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at-at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."<br>
<i>Monica</i>"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

So, are you excited about your scene?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! But I'm a little <b title='-y - tend to do sth'>shaky</b> and nervous.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.<br>
<i>Director</i>Ok, ok, ok! (To Phoebe) You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't <b title='go somewhere or do sth so slowly that people become annoyed with you'>dawdle</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>now</b>, what?<br>

(Phoebe starts walking toward the operating table. Her hands are shaking like crazy, causing the tray to <b title='shakes and makes a quick series of short sounds ↗rattlesnake'>rattle</b>.)<br>
<i>Director</i>Cut! Cut!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.<br>
<i>Director</i>Well, don't be.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, that helps.<br>
<i>Director</i>And...Action!<br>
(Phoebe starts walking towards the table again. She's even more shaky than before and almost drops the tray.)<br>
<i>Director</i>Cut!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you know what? Don't worry about it, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! (Off the director's look) <b title='=all right'>Alright</b>, eight.<br>

(Ok, <b title='used when sth annoying starts to happen again'>here we go again</b>. Phoebe starts walking toward the operating table, but stops every time the tray starts to rattle.

<i>Interviewer</i>So, do you have any other questions about advertising?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no. But let me show you what I can do.

<i>Interviewer</i>Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? That's great!<br>
<i>Interviewer</i>It's an unpaid <b title='a job that lasts for a short time, that sb, esp a student, does in order to gain experience ↗part-time'>internship</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's funny. When-when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."<br>
<i>Interviewer</i>It won't be forever. It just takes a year to get a good <b title='a large flat case for carrying large pieces of paper, esp pictures or paintings / a set of pictures or other pieces of work that an artist, photographer etc has done'>portfolio</b> together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I can skip a couple of steps, right? I mean, you <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> hear my round food thing.<br>
<i>Interviewer</i>Look, you're changing careers. I mean, no matter what you do, you're gonna have to start at the bottom. It's gonna be years before you're making anything near as much as you were before.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So you're paying the <b title='bill'>check</b>, right?<br>
<i>Interviewer</i>Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna <b title='↗delay, put off'>postpone</b> it. Now, we're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably home naked <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Good, because it's in ten minutes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna <b title='pick up - go and meet sb/sth that you have arranged to take somewhere,usu in a car'>pick her up</b> for another hour.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, ok? we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping. But I love that man. I'd follow him into hell. (Whispers) Microphones.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, well <b title='used to say that nothing can be done to change an unsatisfactory situation'>there you go</b>. You win, you win. You <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> do the presentation, you'll <b title='knock sb dead - surprise and please sb by being very impressive'>knock</b> <b title='them'>'em</b> dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!<br>
<i>Gavin</i>You can do the presentation.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I can't, I have a baby.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I'll watch her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why would you do that?<br>
<i>Gavin</i>Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's really nice.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.<br>
<i>Gavin</i>I-I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. (To Emma) Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

<i>Monica</i>Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, that's actually... why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm, I'm not saying that I don't wanna have a baby, I'm just saying, maybe we could wait a little while?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Like-like a month?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Or.. a year?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really, you wanna wait a year?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, I, I really wanna have a baby.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, me too. Look, I'll-I'll, I'll just get my old job back.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I quit and you learn what I do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in-in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but, I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I guess. I mean it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's gonna be really scary. I mean, God. When we have a baby, there's-there's gonna be so much that-that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. <b title='used for asking what would happen in a particular situation'>What if</b> the baby gets into the <b title='↗lace'>ribbon</b> drawer? <b title='mess up - make sth dirty/not neat'>Messes up</b> all the ribbons?!

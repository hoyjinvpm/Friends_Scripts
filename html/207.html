<i>Chandler</i>OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something... <b title='very unpleasant ↗repellent, propeller'>repellant</b>... about me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>So how was the party?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well it couldn't 've been worse. A woman <b title='according to the most basic or original meaning of a word or expression'>literally</b> passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I <b title='used to emphasize the great degree of sth'>hideously</b> unattractive?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I <b title='experience sth difficult or unpleasant'>go through</b> the exact same thing. Every time I <b title='if you put on weight, you become fatter ↗chubby, slender, slim, skinny'>put on a little weight</b>, I start questioning everything.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Woah, woah, I've, I've put on a little weight?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, not wieght... you know, more like <b title='material which is used to insulate (keep sb/sth apart from) sb/sth (insulate Chandler from women) ↗conductor'>insulation</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, I'm unemployed and in <b title='very severe or serious'>dire</b> need of a project. You <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='make your body fit and strong by doing exercises'>work out</b>? I-I can remake you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you know, I would, but that might <b title='prevent sb from doing sth'>get in the way of</b> my lying around time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Please.<br>
<i>All</i>Come on. Let her do it. Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='=all right'>Alright</b>, OK, alright. But if we put on <b title='a material that stretches, used esp for making tight-fitting sports clothes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandex">Wiki</a>] <img src="300px-Cynthia_Barboza-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Cynthia_Barboza.jpg/300px-Cynthia_Barboza.jpg">'>Spandex</b> and my <b title="boob - a woman's breast">boobs</b> are bigger than yours, I'm going home.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should've said anything. Come here. Come here. (hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back) Oh, can't make... hands.. meet..
<s>Hallway between the apartments. Chandler comes out wearing spandex, <b title='jog - run slowly and steadily, esp as a way of exercising'>jogging</b> <b title='in the original position ↗run off'>in place</b>. Monica is there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>OK, let's do it. (Monica looks at him <b title='in a strange or unusual way'>funnily</b>) What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before. It's cute!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And we're changing. (jogs back in his apartment)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Come on give me five more. Five more.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(weakly) No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Five more and I'll <b title='show him her boobs. If a man flashes, or if he flashes sb, he shows his sexual organs in public.'>flash</b> you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>One... two... two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>. Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch. Rachel is working.</s>

(Joey <b title='intercept - stop sb/sth that is going from one place to another before they get there'>intercepts</b> the cup and puts it down for him.) She's <b title='crazy ↗nuts'>insane</b>, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing <b title='excercise where you clench (close tightly) your butt repeatedly. If done regularly and very often, it results in a very fine firm ass'>butt clenches</b> at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Just tell her you wanna stop.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't, ok? While she is out of work, I'm all she's got. That's why I was thinking maybe we can all <b title='join others and pay part of the money towards sth ↗chip in'>pitch in</b> and buy her her own restaurant.<br>
[Phoebe enters.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey Pheebs, how'd it <b title='happen'>go</b> with Scott last night?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant, ordered <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne">Wiki</a>]'>champagne</b>, nice.<br>
<i>Joey</i>The guy still won't <b title='have sex willingly'>put out</b>, huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='no'>Nope</b>, <b title='nothing'>zilch</b>, nothing, uh-uh.<br>
<i>All</i>Sorry Pheebs.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look, I, you know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, you know he's really interesting and he's really <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> and why won't he give it up?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if you know what <b title='↗gay, homosexual, lesbian, straight'>I mean</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>(<b title='slowly and unwillingly'>reluctantly</b>) Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy <b title='Meow+Wellington=Meowington; Monica+Chandler=Mondler, ...'>Meowington's</b> cat toy.<br>

<i>Julie</i>Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.<br>

<s>A nice restraunt. Rachel is on her date with Michael.</s>
<i>Michael</i>I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.<br>

<i>Michael</i>Um, maybe 15, 16 years.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's just great. (she picks up her champagne and starts drinking.)<br>

<i>Michael</i>Monica told you I was <b title="cute - sexually attractive. (So now you're disappointed.)">cuter</b> that this, didn't she?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.<br>
<i>Michael</i>Oh, that does sound...Ahh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean he just started <b title='↗ask out, date, move in, break up, dump, engagement'>going out</b> with her.<br>

<s>Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, I <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth'>figured it out</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why Scott doesn't wanna sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Phoebe, that's <b title='stupid/not sensible'>crazy</b>. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great <b title="women's breasts, particularly unusually large breasts. The allusion (indirect reference) is rather obvious: a comparison to an impressive, horizontal display.">rack</b>."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? So sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended you know, so sweet.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pheebs look, if you wanna know what the <b title='what is happening'>deal</b> is, you're just <b title='going to'>gonna</b> have to ask him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so <b title='an affectionate (showing love/care) term for a friend or sb of the opposite sex you find attractive [<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yum">link</a>]'>yum</b>. (They hug.)<br>

<s>Back in the restraunt. Rachel pours the last of the champange bottle in her glass.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(obviously drunk) I mean it's a cat, you know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, you know, one of those fruit flies, those things that live for like a day or something? (<b title='belligerent - very unfriendly and angry'>belligerently</b>) What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?<br>
<i>Michael</i>Fruit flies?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! Thank you.<br>
[The waiter comes to the table.]<br>
<i>WAITER</i>So, would you like any dessert?<br>
<i>Michael</i>No! No dessert, just the <b title='bill'>check</b>, please.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no, you're not having fun, are you?<br>
<i>Michael</i>No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner_%28film%29">Wiki</a>]'>Diner</b> in my head.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie.<br>
<i>Michael</i>Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Ah! Too late for that <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>. I have just <b title='screw up - ruin/spoil sth. all - completely'>screwed this all up</b>. I just want to <b title='get over sb - start to forget sb and feel happy again'>get over</b> him. God, I just, why can't I do that?<br>
<i>Michael</i>Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me, you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any <b title='the feeling that an unpleasant experience has ended or been settled'>closure</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're <b title='extremely clever, very intelligent'>brilliant</b>! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?<br>
<i>Michael</i>Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm <b title='no longer in love with'>over</b> you."<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Over you, that's what it is. Closure. (She looks around the restaurant, <b title='spot - notice'>spotting</b> a guy with a <b title='cellphone, mobile phone'>cellular phone</b>) Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel... woo [she almost falls out of her chair]<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.<br>
<i>Guy</i>I'm talking!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. (The man is still reluctant) OK, you're being a little weird about your phone.<br>
<i>Guy</i>(On the phone) I'll call you back. (Hands the phone to her)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. (To Michael in a drunk way) I am so good with people. (Dials) <b title='answering machine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answering_machine">Wiki</a>]'>Machine</b>. Just waiting for the beep.<br>
<i>Michael</i>Good.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And you know, you see there I'm thinking of names so <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b>, I am over you.

<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I didn't get a cat.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, that's um, interesting.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. It's actually 100 percent completely the opposite of interesting.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Alright, I <b title='get - understand'>got</b> it Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(hurt) What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, I was doing great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well then you should have said something before I met her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>There was never a good time.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Right, you, you only had a year. And we only <b title='hang out - hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hung out</b> every night.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but all things <b title='get in the way - prevent sb from doing sth, or prevent sth from happening'>got in the way</b>, you know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés or, or, or Italian guys.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK? and do you even have a <b title='idea/opinion/reason'>point</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It's, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok so what're you saying, you just sort of <b title='put away - put sth in the place where it is usu kept ↗set aside, tidy up'>put away</b> feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, I've been doing it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't need your stupid ship.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Good.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Good. (Ross leaves)<br>
[Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And you know what, now I got closure.<br>
[Rachel slams the door and locks it. She sits down, visibly upset. She puts her head in her hands and begins to cry. Ross comes back and is standing outside the window. When Rachel <b title='regroup - stop and think about sth, so that you can start to do sth again in a better way'>regroups</b> and gets back up to finish closing, she sees him. She smiles. She goes to open the door and can't get the lock undone.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Try the bottom one.<br>
[She opens the door and they kiss.]

<i>Chandler</i>Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ooh, <b title='what are ya (you)'>what'cha</b> <b title='going to'>gonna</b> do, fat boy, huh? What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, thanks.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean, especially considering how <b title='difficult'>tough</b> it's been for you to find work.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you know.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(sad) Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And it's not <b title='used for emphasizing that sth is not true'>as if</b> you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well no, but um.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.<br>

<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we <b title='take off - leave'>took off</b> in the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss <b title="↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">stares</b> at them.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, Ross, I-I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but uh.. Let me explain, ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We weren't doing anything!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rach, he just saw us.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Shhh.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But what you saw, that is the <b title='the degree to which sth happens'>extent</b> of it, ok? One kiss.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados">Wiki</a>]'>Barbados</b>.<br>
<i>Joey (to Rachel)</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, <b title='relax and stop being angry or nervous'>chill</b>! (to Ross) O-Ok, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, ok? And the only reason that that happened was-was because I saw you kissing Charlie.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, we-we probably should've talked to you about this before it ever happened, but-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, but it <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b>, happen, so.<br>
(Ross looks <b title='↗stunned, dumbfounded, dumbstruck'>shocked</b> and says nothing.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, say something. Anything.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So you two, are?<br>
<i>Joey and Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And have you.. <b title='-ed - used to form the past tense and past participle of regular verbs'>ed</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, no, no, no!<br>
<i>Ross</i>But if I hadn't walked in here, would you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Probably.<br>
(Rachel looks at him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to <b title='become crazy'>go nuts</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm not going nuts. Do you see me going nuts?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, but you know what I mean.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, hey, hey. If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (<b title='making a squeaking sound. squeak - say sth in a high voice'>Squeaky</b>) I'm fine!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, <b title='because'>'cause</b> really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to-to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But <b title='because/as a result of sth'>now, that</b> I've had time to absorb it; Loving this.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross..<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's all <b title='work out - prove effective or successful'>working out</b>! Me and Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Calm ourselves?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, don't-don't you think that will be a little weird?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Weird? What? What's weird? I don't know, the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making <b title='fajita - commonly referring to any grilled meat usu served as a taco on a flour or corn tortilla. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Beef_Fajitas_Costa_Rica.JPG/220px-Beef_Fajitas_Costa_Rica.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fajita">Wiki</a>]'>fajitas</b>!

They have lots of <b title='a thin book giving information or advertising sth ↗pamphlet, booklet, flyer, flier'>brochures</b> about <b title='the process of making a child legally part of your family'>adoption</b> in front of them.</s>
<i>Monica</i>God, this adoption <b title='things'>stuff</b> is so <b title='If sth is overwhelming, you do not know how to deal with it'>overwhelming</b>. There's <b title='between'>inter-</b>country adoption, <b title="present relationship between two persons, one of whom is sustained by, looks to or relies on aid of the other for support or reasonable necessaries consistent with the dependent 's position in life.">dependency</b> adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's a hair in my coffee.<br>
(Phoebe enters.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey guys!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the <b title='↗twin'>triplets</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three <b title='sexy'>hot</b> blonde 19-year-olds.<br>
(Monica glares at him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing (sarcasticly)'>sweet</b>. Drink your hair.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, what's all this stuff?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's not really how it works.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, how does it work?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if you're <b title='have a hard time - be difficult for sb to do sth'>having a hard time</b>, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?<br>
(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in <a href="605.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/605.html">605</a>. It's the hair in his coffee.)<br>
(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.<br>
(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffee house.)<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>That's not what we talked about!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good to see you.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Good to see you, too.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi Frank.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Hi, how're you doing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, <b title='used for showing that you are surprised'>my goodness</b>, they've all <b title='the past participle of "get" is got or gotten'>gotten</b> so big!<br>
(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is throwing <b title='bagel - a type of bread that is small and round with a hole in the middle'>bagels</b> at him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Which one is which again?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the <b title='tampon - a tube-shaped that a woman puts inside her vagina to collect the blood during her period ↗sanitary towel, menstrual period'>tampons</b> out of the lady's <b title='handbag'>purse</b>. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him. She's got quite an arm there, doesn't she? Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, guys, come give me a <b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle, snuggle'>hug</b>. Triplets, hug your aunt! Oh, oh, oh, it's like hugging fresh cookies. Ok, I'm gonna eat you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So how've you been, Frank?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, good, you know. Life is <b title='satisfactory, but not excellent =ok'>all right</b>. Just <b title='take - accept'>taking</b> it <b title='every day. by - next to'>day by day</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Seems like somebody needs something from you.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, no. He's just trying to pull my shoulder out of it's <b title='a part of the body into which another part fits ↗joint'>socket</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>No, it's fine. After I <b title='become unconscious ↗pass out, faint'>black out</b>, he tries to put it back in, so-<br>
<i>Monica</i> (reads a form in her lap) "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
<s>The <b title='corridor'>hallway</b> in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their way to Ross's dinner.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and <b title='used to say that you agree with sth, that you understand it, or that it does not annoy you'>that's cool</b>, but if it was <b title='my decision ↗my call'>up to me</b>, this is not what we'd be doing on our first <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>In a <b title='vehicle pulled by horse'>carriage</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe we can have our date later on tonight. You know, after this, we'll go back to our apartment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, right. Yeah. We could <b title='start equipment =turn/switch on'>put on</b> some music, light some candles, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b>-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You <b title='want to'>wanna</b> say feel me up, don't you?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, <b title='used to emphasize that you agree with sb'>you bet</b>.<br>
(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, did you bring a little something for Ross?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Actually.. Uh, it's some stuff you left at my apartment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Oh, thanks.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.<br>
(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite <b title='behaving in an excited and nervous way'>hyper</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I thought I heard voices! Hi, Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He <b title='squeeze - press sth firmly with your hands'>squeezes</b> her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, uh well, we brought you some wine.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a <b title='one that is worth keeping'>keeper</b>. And what did you bring me? (<b title='↗snatch'>Grabs</b> the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, actually, that's uh..<br>
<i>Ross</i>Underwear, a toothbrush, and <b title='an American hard rock band [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen">Wiki</a>]'>Van Halen</b> CD. I can use all these things!<br>
<i>Charlie</i><b title='used for showing that you are surprised or a little annoyed'>Gosh</b>, Ross, you know, you seem a little uh..<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who-who else is fine?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, ok? Maybe have a drink.<br>

<i>Frank Jr.</i>Yeah, I really <b title='think that sth is very important and to wish to keep it'>cherish</b> these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.<br>

<i>Frank Jr.</i>You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of <b title='them'>'em</b>. You know, two I can handle. Two's great.

<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>No, I can't.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just <b title='suddenly leave your wife, husband etc =walk out on ↗desert, abandon'>run out on</b> them!<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! You-you can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?

<s>Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.<br>
<i>Colleen</i>Oh, please, we're happy to help.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So, a lot of <b title='malfunction - fail to work or operate correctly'>malfunctioning</b> <b title='wee-wee - male genitalia (the outer sexual organs, esp the penis or vulva)'>wee-wees</b> and <b title='hoo-hoo - female genitalia'>hoo-hoos</b> in this room, huh?<br>
(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean, you have a lovely home.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.<br>
<i>Colleen</i>Well, actually, I think this might help.<br>
(She gives Monica a big <b title='a removable cover for holding loose sheets of paper, magazines etc'>binder</b> that's perfectly in order.)<br>
<i>Colleen</i>It's <b title='almost'>pretty much</b> all the information you need.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Colleen</i>Everything is broken down into categories, and then <b title='make a note in a book that tells you to look at another page for more information'>cross-referenced</b>, and then color-coded to <b title='if two things or ideas correspond, the parts or information in one relate to the parts or information in the other ↗respective'>correspond</b> with the forms in the back.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny <b title='the greatest point of sexual pleasure ↗climax, peak'>orgasm</b>.<br>
<i>Bill</i>I know the process is <b title='making you feel annoyed and impatient because you are prevented from achieving sth'>frustrating</b>, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?<br>
(Monica looks at him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's.. It's just so pretty and white.<br>
<i>Colleen</i>Bathroom is down the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>, to your left.<br>
(Chandler leaves.)<br>
<i>Colleen</i>I would've told him to do it too.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Can I adopt you?<br>
(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting'>scout</b>-uniform and is <b title='look through - search for sth among a lot of other things'>looking through a box</b> when Chandler walks up to him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, you must be Owen.<br>
<i>Owen</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.<br>
<i>Owen</i>You were?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, in fact my father was a <b title='a woman who is in charge of a group of cub scouts (an organization for young boys who learn practical skills and moral values)'>den mother</b>.<br>
<i>Owen</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know how to use a compass?<br>
<i>Owen</i>I have a <b title='a small piece of metal or plastic that shows that you have achieved sth'>badge</b> in it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You do? That's fantastic!<br>
<i>Owen</i>You wanna see it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.<br>
<i>Owen</i>What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Owen</i>I'm adopted?<br>
(Chandler tries to <b title='think of'>come up with</b> a good answer.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I got nothing.<br>
<i>Owen</i>I'm adopted?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Noo. I didn't say that. I said.you're a doctor. A doctor. Hey doctor, my arm hurts, can you fix it for me?<br>
<i>Owen</i>I can't believe I'm adopted.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, you're not gonna fix my arm?
<s>Ross's apartment. Ross is totally <b title='↗drunk, drunker, hammered, tanked'>wasted</b>, but he's still drinking all the margaritas.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Well, that first <b title='an amount of food, medicine etc produced at one time'>batch</b> of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just <b title='hang - spend time in a place'>hanging</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dude, are you ok? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm fine! Ok, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. You know, there's no weirdness, no tension.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No awareness.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, we make a great <b title='-some - a group of a particular number ↗threesome'>foursome</b>. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. We could all go on your boat. Joey has this amazing <b title='a small boat that is moved by the wind in a sail or sails'>sailboat</b>. <br>
<i>Joey</i>Actually, Ross, I sold the boat two years ago.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, no. <b title='↗retarded, imbecile, moron'>Idiot</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, yeah, yeah, but I could get another one. This trip sounds great.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? Ok, where do you think we-we, we can go?<br>
(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>My fajitas!<br>
(He runs off to the kitchen.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a <b title='very great and hard to control'>raging</b> <b title='sb who finds it difficult to control the amount of alcohol they drink'>alcoholic</b>.<br>
(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?<br>
(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven mitts.)<br>

<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, no, of course we're not.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Insane.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>I know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alice would never <b title='like'>go for</b> it, right?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, I don't know, she's <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> tired, too, I think we'll get her <b title='as part of a group or team / in agreement with a plan'>on board</b>.<br>

Which one would you be willing to give up?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Frank Jr.Jr.?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Well, it'd be great for my shoulder. Oh, you'd be getting a really good one, he's really funny. Like, <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> he <b title='make up - invent'>made up</b> this joke. What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, alright, that's fine. What about um, Leslie?<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to <b title='let air from your stomach come out loudly through your mouth ↗belch "To belch the alphabet" is to say all of the letters of the alphabet while belching. <a href="http://rec.st/33d">Fastest Time To Burp The English Alphabet (Video)</a>'>burp the alphabet</b>.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, Frank. I think we just <b title='run out of - use up'>ran out of</b> kids.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of 'em up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll-I'll <b title='help'>help out</b> more. I can-I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>How about tomorrow?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, that's not good. But you know, I can <b title='change some things'>move some stuff around</b>, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>You know what, Ross? I think, I think we're gonna take off too.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm crazy about her.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.<br>

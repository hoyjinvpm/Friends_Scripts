<i>Rachel</i>They made you head of the department!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn't I get head of the department?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well that's great, You always wanted to teach an advanced class.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>What?! Joey, you don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go on a date with a pregnant lady.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Why do you wanna play this game so <b title='very much'>badly</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! It's not like it spits out a <b title='a milk chocolate peanut butter bar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_bar">Wiki</a>]'>Clark bar</b> after every game.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Phoebe <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Come on! Come on! Out of the chair.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God. And that works?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just wanna have a normal life!"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you poor little <b title='↗celebrity, star'>famous man</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh ok, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're just beautiful...I don't think I can.<br>

<i>Monica</i>What is the matter with your hand?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it-it'll loosen up. Come on, <b title='look at'>check out</b> the scores. Oh, and also look at the <b title='the first letters of all your names in order ↗abbreviation, acronym'>initials</b>, they're dirty words.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, why would you do that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because it's <b title='very impressive ↗cool'>awesome</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You think this is clever?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But clearly you're <b title='clever, good, or well enough to do sth ↗be good at, suck'>up to</b> the task. Hey wait a minute, this one is not dirty.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well it is when you put it together with that one.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Come on, he won't even know what they mean.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Have you talked to him <b title='recently'>lately</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of <b title='↗advanced, sophisticated'>primitive</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">Read-only Memory</a>]'>ROM</b> Chip in it or something!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, the dirty words and the computer talk. This is just the coolest you've ever been. Honey you-you gotta beat your scores!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>With the claw?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. Just gotta get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him <b title='...pull the finger of the joker, who simultaneously farts... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_my_finger">Wiki</a>]'>pull my finger</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Me too! Hey, Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, I think everybody saw the wine come out of your nose.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, that is because you have never been on a date with me before.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh. Huh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, now don't <b title='criticize'>judge</b> me. I normally wait till my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into <b title='leftovers wrapped in swan-shaped aluminum foil'>this swan</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah! Ok, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the <b title='a thin transparent material used for wrapping things [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane">Wiki</a>]'>Cellophane</b> from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How do you do that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip <b title='an oily liquid with a nice smell that you rub into your skin [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balm">Wiki</a>] ↗palm'>balm</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you. Ok, all right, so, now you go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I don't wanna tell you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because it's embarrassing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>More embarrassing than shiny <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Raspberries05.jpg/220px-Raspberries05.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry">Wiki</a>]'>raspberry</b> lip balm?!

<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) Ok. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Ok, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='surprised or shocked'>stunned</b> and <b title='turn on - make sb feel sexually excited'>turned on</b>) Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for <b title='you'>ya</b>...<br>

<i>Ross</i>No, I ran. Ok? It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, why didn't you just take a cab?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller">Wiki</a>]'>Rockefeller</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.<br>

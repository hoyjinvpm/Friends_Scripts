<s>Chandler and Monica's apartment.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we, can we talk about what happened here last night?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure! Just give me a second to get all <b title='in a bad mood ↗angry, upset'>huffy</b> and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do I mean <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, OK you...you, you really don't know what I am talking about?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No!<br>
<i>Ross</i>OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that <b title='sb who does stupid, annoying, or unkind things'>jerk</b> from her office out on your balcony.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said "No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will."<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum, I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, even though there were NO LIGHTS !<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, are you <b title='going to'>gonna</b>...talk to her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why? Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! I'm-I'm serious. I mean she wants to <b title='have a romantic meeting with sb ↗ask out, go out'>date</b> people? Fine! I don't care but she...at least she could've told me. You know I-I've been putting my life <b title='if sth is on hold, it is going to be done or dealt with at a later date rather than now ↗postpone, delay, put off'>on hold</b> and just <b title='↗focus'>concentrating</b> on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she <b title='↗hardly'>barely</b> knows, then so will I! Very funny! Ross is <b title='↗lesbian, straight, homosexual, heterosexual, come out (of the closet)'>gay</b>! Ha ha!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving on to?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. I mean I got plenty of opportunities. I mean just-<b title='a very short time ago ↗by now, right now'>just now</b>, just know, there were <b title='used to mean sb/sth, when you do not know or say exactly which ↗this'>some</b> woman at the coffee house smiled at me. <b title='in addition'>And then</b> <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> on the subway, a woman "<b title='↗on purpose, intentional, deliberate'>accidentally</b>" sat on my hand.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, don't <b title="rub (sb's) face in - make fun of sb for sth they did or failed to do">rub my face in</b> your crazy single life!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, and then, how about this? There is an <b title='anthropology - the scientific study of people, their societies, cultures etc'>anthropologist</b> at school who totally <b title='come on to - behave toward sb in a way that shows you would like to have a sexual relationship with them'>came on to</b> me during the <b title='between ↗international, Internet'>inter-</b>departmental <b title='a gathering of people where each person or group of people may contribute a dish of food prepared by the person or the group of people, to be shared among the group.

I have a new <b title='headshot - a photograph of the head <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Naiara_Moraes.jpg/180px-Naiara_Moraes.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headshot">Wiki</a>]'>headshots</b> taken tomorrow right, and the photographer said that she thinks I should have my eyebrows <b title='wax - remove the hair from legs etc using wax'>waxed</b>. Is that weird for a guy?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well <b title='used to say that you cannot give a definite answer to sth because your answer will be affected by sth else'>it depends</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>On...?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>On how far along he's in the <b title='↗transsexual'>sex</b> change process!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I totally disagree. No I-I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. <b title='especially'>Such</b> you're an actor. I mean <b title='used to say you are not suggesting sth'>not that</b> you need to, your eyebrows are...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're <b title='freak sb out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaking me out</b>!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hey hey hey! You <b title='change the color of sth such as clothing or your hair using dye'>dye</b> your hair!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm a woman!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Arghhh! Double standards!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Only if I don't have to get <b title='up the stage'>up</b> and sing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this <b title='attractive'>adorable</b> old man got out there, forgot all of the words, <b title='flip out - become very anxious, upset or afraid =freak out'>flipped out</b> and everyone <b title="boo - shout 'boo' to show that you do not like a person, performance, idea etc ↗bravo, applause, clap">booed</b> him off the stage. It's so funny.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But I'm just, I'm not good at singing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? Huh? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna <b title='defeat'>beat</b> you at singing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, no, it's-it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>OK, fine! Just, please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait- So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and <b title='give'>pass</b> <b title='judge - criticize'>judgments</b> on others?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>While drinking.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Huh, I'm there!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi you guys! Listen, I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well yes Rachel but you got <b title='Emma'>something so beautiful</b> out there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, not that. You guy, I kissed Gavin last night.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my god.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You kissed him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, yeah...So, how-how did you <b title='↗turn out'>end up</b> kissing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...<br>
<i>Monica</i>I-I thought you <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hated</b> him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it <b title='turn out - end up, prove to be'>turns out</b> that line...is a scarf!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So are-are you thinking of <b title='start sth up - make sth begin to exist'>starting something up</b> with this guy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't know what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow. Sounds like you need to think about what you want, and talk to Gavin, and you <b title='↗absolutely, certainly'>definitely</b> should talk to Ross.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Or...I could <b title='phone to say you are not coming to work because you are ill'>call in sick</b> and not deal with it at all...<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Are you trying to get everybody divorced?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on, you don't have to do anything. It'll just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember?

<i>Gavin</i>Exactly how <b title='a disease that is contagious can be passed from person to person by touch ↗infection, infectious'>contagious</b> is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?<br>

<i>Gavin</i>Right. Right. Ross. So what's the <b title='agreement ↗matter'>deal</b> with you guys? I don't wanna get in the middle of anything.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you're not, you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. (She hears the noise of the key in the lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide, hide.<br>

<i>Molly</i>No, I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Uhm... All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I-I felt guilty, that you were here, which I shouldn't.

<i>Michelle</i>Actually about an hour and a half.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I told you it wasn't long, but uh there is an amazing connection between us.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How do you know about that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...<br>
<i>Michelle</i>Emma.<br>
<i>Ross</i>When I <b title='↗by chance'>happened to</b> look through the window and see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God, you know what, I can not believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, really?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, really?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What about the guy from the bar?<br>

<i>Ross</i>The guy you gave your number to.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How do you know about that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because he called here looking for you.

<i>Rachel</i>Why didn't I get that message?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because I folded it up and put it in my pants pocket. Do you, do you not look there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I never gave it to you.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you, to decide what messages I should or should not get?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who am I?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, I cannot believe you. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us! But I can't do that with someone who-who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! None of the <b title='↗insane, crazy'>sane</b> ones wanted to come back with me! That's, that's not the <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b>. Ok? The point is, you, you are the one who moved on and didn't tell anyone!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God, Ross, this is just so <b title='mess up - spoil, ruin, make sth untidy, make a mistake and do sth badly'>messed up</b>! Uh, what is wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they always ask? What, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I say you know-you know what, it's not, because it works for us! But you know what, this doesn't work. In fact this is the-the opposite of working!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, clearly.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And you know, we said that we would, we would live together <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> this <b title='make sense - be reasonable/sensible ↗logical'>makes sense</b>. And maybe this, you know, just doesn't make sense anymore.<br>

<i>Ross</i>You bug me.<br>
[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is <b title='very shocked or upset'>stunned</b>.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is there any chance you didn't see that?
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring out the peephole.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross! You gotta stop! Ok?! You can't just stare through the peephole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! You know, she'd say no, but <b title='used to say that you have just found sth'>here we are</b>! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You didn't just break up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, it's been like three weeks!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets 've left guns slower!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Here they come, here they- oh-, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. (Turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Oh- oh, <b title='used when sth is starting to happen'>here we go</b>, hey, she's going in.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything with the door closed!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And the inventor of the door <b title='↗R.I.P. - rest in peace, requiescat in pace, gravestone, tombstone, headstone'>rests happily in his grave</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Stop what?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, but I ah, I have a feeling that my being there will <b title='have an effect'>do</b> it. Look, this guy is bad news, Chandler. He's- I can sense he's an <b title='sb who is very good at getting what they want ↗manipulative, diplomatic, tactful, smooth'>operator</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!<br>
(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing hold of the foosball table.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No!! You can't!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, they must be stopped!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I need juice! People need juice!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>People need juice!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Juice, they need...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She's moving on! Ok, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about <b title='sublet - rent to sb else a property that you rent from its owner ↗landlord, tenant, lease'>subletting</b> my peephole, you, are gonna have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Ok, man? It's over.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's just I miss her so much.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. (He rubs Ross's head and steps down) I know. Is it me, or did "subletting my peephole" sound <b title='↗asshole, pee'>kind of dirty</b>? (Ross thinks about it.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.</s>
<i>Mark</i>Why do all your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'<br>
(She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesn't react. He tries it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what?<br>
<i>Mark</i>No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can't do this.<br>
<i>Mark</i><b title='yes, yup'>Yep</b>. Yep, that's what I didn't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, oh, Mark, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know? I'm-I'm just doing it to <b title='hurt or upset sb after they have hurt or upset you'>get back at</b> Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.<br>

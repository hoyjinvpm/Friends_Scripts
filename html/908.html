<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey <b title='honey'>hon</b>, would you help me get the plates down?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding <b title='a hard white substance made from clay ↗porcelain, pottery'>china</b> today?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Or, we can save them for a, a <b title='fancy hotels, restaurants, cars etc are expensive and fashionable'>fancy</b> special occasion.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How about this, you could treat me like I'm an <b title='sb who is as important, intelligent etc as you are'>equal</b>, or, talk down to me like I'm a child.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I just think that we should save our china for something really special, like, if the Queen of England <b title='come over - visit ↗come by, drop by, stop by'>comes over</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, she keeps canceling on us. Take the <b title='sth that is made in an indirect way ↗imply'>hint</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used when you ask about the consequences of sth happening, esp sth undesirable or unpleasant'>What if</b> something gets broken? They're so expensive!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What is the <b title='purpose'>point</b> of having them if we never use them?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, but if something gets broken, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> the Queen comes over...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I will explain it to her.<br>
<i>Monica</i> (Laughing) Oh yeah, like I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> let you talk to the Queen.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow, the <b title='a public celebration when musical bands, brightly decorated vehicles etc move down the street ↗procession'>parade</b> is really good this year. <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b> those horses can <b title='pass waste matter from the body ↗poo, defecate'>crap</b>!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Muskogee! That's like four hours from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa">Wiki</a>]'>Tulsa</b>. Woo-hoo! <b title='you all, all of you'>Y'all</b> look great! That's right, I said "y'all!"<br>
<i>TV announcer</i>And here's the <b title='a large vehicle that is decorated to drive through the streets as part of a special event'>float</b> with the stars of the popular daytime <b title='soap opera [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera">Wiki</a>]'>soap</b> Days of Our Lives.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write <b title='things'>stuff</b> like this <b title='write down - write sth (on a piece of paper). Or, like "Hang up means the same as hang", "write down means the same as write" ↗help out'>down</b> on my arm.<br>
(Chandler grabs Joey's arm and pushes the sleeve up)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! Stupid long sleeves.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I guess I'm gonna have to <b title='think of'>come up with</b> a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are gonna be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM <b title='exactly at the stated time ↗about, around'>sharp</b>, that means you Tribbiani." Like... like I was some <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='↗moron, maroon, retarded, imbecile'>idiot</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well you proved them wrong.<br>
<i>Joey nods</i>Yeah.

(Ross and Rachel are putting baby stuff together like they're going to be going somewhere.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i> (To Emma) Oh Emma. This is your first <b title='celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States and on the second Monday of October in Canada. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving">Wiki</a>]'>Thanksgiving</b>. What're you thankful for? Mommy's <b title="a woman's breasts">bobbies</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>A lot of people are thankful for those.<br>
(knock on door)<br>
<i>Woman at door</i>Hello? Rachel?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Woman at door</i>It's your favorite sister.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Jill?<br>
<i>Woman at door</i>Amy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hide my rings.<br>
(Ross goes into Rachel's room)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. (opens door preparing herself and then happily says) <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Applegate">Christina Applegate</a>]'>Amy</b>! Happy Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Do you have a hair <b title='-en - make/become'>straightener</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Um... hi.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh... hi... (goes to Rachel with open arms)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw.<br>
(Amy grabs her arms)<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hair straightener?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I haven't seen you in like a year.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, I know, I know. I've just been <b title='=crazy ↗insane'>crazed</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh well yeah me too. Um... I had a baby.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I decorated Dad's office.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh... yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your <b title="the passage connecting a women's outer sex organs to her womb ↗clitoris, cervix, womb">vagina</b>, (shakes head no) not the same thing.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Listen, um, about the hair straightener, honey... I really need one. I'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house.<br>
(Amy bending over <b title='fiddle - make restless or aimless movements with the hands ↗fumble'>fiddling</b> with her <b title='handbag'>purse</b> when Emma cries and she hears Emma)<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>mh hmm...<br>
<i>Amy</i>Is this Emmett? (pointing to Emma)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uhh, it's Emma.<br>
<i>Amy</i>It's a girl?<br>
(Ross comes out of the bedrooms)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Amy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Amy, you remember Ross.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title="used to say 'no' or 'not' in a less strong way ↗no way">Not really</b>. But you are much <b title='cute - sexually attractive'>cuter</b> then that <b title='boring and not fashionable ↗nerd'>geeky</b> guy she used to date.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That was me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, he was this <b title='making you feel nervous and slightly frightened'>creepy</b> guy from high school who had this huge <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on her since like the ninth grade.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Still me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, I'm not talking about you.

(Joey is walking around looking worried. )<br>
<i>Monica</i>Careful. (hands Chandler a china plate) Careful. CAREFUL!<br>
(Chandler is <b title='startle - alarm, frighten, or surprise sb suddenly'>startled</b> and nearly drops the plates.) Sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used when you are suggesting sth'>I'll tell you what</b>, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. (looks at china) hey this isn't the china we <b title='pick out - choose sb/sth from a group'>picked out</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well <b title='used for telling sb that you hope that what you are saying will not offend them'>no offense</b> honey, but your taste is a little <b title='↗masculine, girlie, sissy'>feminine</b> for me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?<br>
(Phoebe comes in)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey happy Thanksgiving... Pheebs! (<b title='motion - give sb directions or instructions by moving your hand or head ↗signal, gesture'>motions</b> her to come over)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, what's going on Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I... I... I need a good lie.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh ok. How about the whole "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories">Moon landing conspiracy theories</a>]'>man walking on the moon</b>" thing. You know? You-you could. You could see the strings people!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, no. I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, honey. You <b title='be very bad at ↗suck'>stink</b> at lying.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I do not.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh really? Ok, let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the <b title="↗restroom, men's room, ladies' room">bathroom</b> and when I came back, my <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/NCI_Visuals_Food_Muffins.jpg/250px-NCI_Visuals_Food_Muffins.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin">Wiki</a>]'>muffin</b> was gone-who took it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Raccoon_%28Procyon_lotor%29_2.jpg/220px-Raccoon_%28Procyon_lotor%29_2.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon">Wiki</a>]'>raccoon</b> came running in, and went straight for your muffin, I said "Hey! Don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said... (pause) He said... "Joey you stink at lying." What am I gonna do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't worry, don't. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure, what... what was the work thing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh... (forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>"<b title='pick up - go and meet sb/sth, and take them somewhere (usu in a car)'>Pick up</b> grandma at the airport"?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh... <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>...
<s>Ross and Rachel's Apartment.</s>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, she's <b title='↗dear, beloved'>precious</b>. Do you <b title='at any timer'>ever</b> worry that she's gonna get your real nose?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Amy! (pause) Yes I do... I really do. (grabs Ross' hand for support)<br>
(Amy's <b title='mobile phone'>cellphone</b> rings)<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on <b title='a very short period of time'>one sec</b>. (to Ross and Rachel) Can I take this upstairs?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure, we don't live there, but...<br>
<i>Amy</i>Seriously? It's... just these rooms? (moves hands around motioning 'just these rooms') (To Ross) I thought you were a doctor.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, no. Ross has a-a <b title='Doctor of Philosophy a university degree'>PhD</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Ew. (walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>God, she is unbelievable.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an <b title='Doctor of Medicine'>MD</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I ever have a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack">Wiki</a>]'>heart attack</b> in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Storms out) Stupid Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? What happened?<br>
<i>Amy</i>My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean... I-I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, it's-it's almost not even worth <b title='date - have a romantic relationship with ↗ask out, go out'>dating</b> married guys.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Don't say that.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were gonna have <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi">Wiki</a>]'>sushi</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um... Ross, could I talk to you in private?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure, you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go upstairs?<br>
(Ross and Rachel go in the kitchen)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Um, look, I was thinking... If it's ok with Monica, I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, I think that's a great idea. It'll be like the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_%28Plymouth_Colony%29">Wiki</a>] ↗Mayflower, Plymouth'>pilgrims</b> bringing the Indians <b title='a sexually transmitted infection [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis">Wiki</a>] ↗VD (venereal disease), AIDS'>syphilis</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look I know she's a little <b title='difficult'>tough</b> to <b title='accept'>take</b>. But she has no where else to go, and she's my sister. <b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to <b title='develop a special relationship'>bond</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, fine, but I-I don't want them bonding too much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a <b title='↗plastic/cosmetic surgery'>nose job</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh? Ross, you know what? She may need one...We're just gonna have to <b title="make one's peace with - bring oneself to accept">make our peace</b> with that!<br>
(Rachel grabs Ross' hand for support and starts to cry a little)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Amy? Amy? Amy!<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm out in the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>, your baby had some sort of explosion of stink.<br>
<i>Ross</i>The bonding is going great.
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(Opens their door) Hi.<br>
<i>Everyone</i>Hi, hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. (To Amy) This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.<br>
<i>Everyone</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Laughs) Yeah.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Wow. They must put a lot of <b title='↗cosmetic'>makeup</b> on you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Looks <b title='↗unhappy, disappointed, distressed, depressed, despondent'>dejected</b>) Hap... Hap... Happy Thanksgiving, yeah.<br>
(Joey turns away and Chandler <b title='reassuring - make sb feel less worried or frightened ↗soothe, console, comfort, condolence'>reassuringly</b> pats him on the back)<br>
(Monica and Ross hug and kiss on check)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Amy) So welcome. Uhm, is this your first time you're seeing Emma?<br>
<i>Amy</i>(With <b title='↗puzzled, bemused, perplexed, bewildered'>confused</b> look on face) Yeah I... I think so. (<b title='stick - put'>sticks</b> her hand out to shake hands with Phoebe and says to her) It's nice to meet you Emma.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Shakes her hand and says) Phoe-Be.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh. That's a funny noise.<br>
(Monica and Amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret closet)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pheebs, I still need some help here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, right, ok um. Ok, so it's not just the lie you tell. but it's the way you tell it. For example, if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh... I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know... I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a <b title='great'>terrific</b> actor.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Looks down) You are a terrific actor.<br>
(Joey realizes what she's doing)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I could talk to the producers for you. I'm a great liar. <b title='consider'>Take</b> Monica's dress, I said I loved it, I hated it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm also a great moron.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Coming out of the bathroom) Where's the baby?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh we just put her down for a nap.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Oh, listen, I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(First has a look of 'huh' then changes it to <b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastic</b> happy) Thank you Amy.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would <b title='show unexpected skill in dealing with a difficulty that arises'>rise to the occasion</b> and then, and I'd get <b title='renovation. renovate - repair a building or old furniture so that it is in good condition again'>make over</b> and then I'd get married.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's a great movie. (she claps)<br>
(Joey nods in agreement)<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b>, listen, <b title='used before a sentence to mean the opposite of what follows it'>not that</b> you guys could stop me or anything <b title='because'>'cause</b> you know, you'd be dead. But, I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Emma.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Turns around to Phoebe) Emma, Ross wants you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>PHOE-BE.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Turns to Ross and Rachel) Why does she keep making that noise?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, I-I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something <b title='be to + infinitive - used when discussing formal or official arrangements'>were to</b> happen to Ross or myself (Ross and Rachel <b title="to undo jinx (bad luck, curse) ↗She's into superstitions black cats and voodoo dolls. I feel a premonition (feeling) that girl's gonna make me fall... (Living La Vida Loca)">knock on wood</b>) um, you wouldn't get the baby.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, who would?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Who?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're in their apartment.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah oh my God, I'm so <b title='move - affect sb emotionally ↗moving, touch'>moved</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>I don't believe this, <b title='wait'>hold on</b> a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, Amy, see, we-we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Connected? I mean... to what? She's... she's a <b title='sb who is stupid or clumsy (awkward)'>lump</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, guys, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> say, this means so much to me. I mean, that you would trust me, with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I 've been trying to have a baby of our own. And you know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two... that you two..... (starts to cry)<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Points to Chandler) This guy? Seriously?<br>
<u></u>
[Later in the day.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! It's time for dinner. Everyone, we-we're using our fancy china... um and it's-it's very expensive, so please be careful.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Starts playing with a plate) Woah. Woah... (nearly really drops the plate and more seriously) Woah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, uh, just to be clear, <b title='entertainment that is intended to make people laugh ↗comedian, tragedy, tragic'>comedy</b> with the plates will not be well <b title='↗react'>recieved</b>. (<b title="pinch - press a part of sb's skin very tightly between your finger and thumb">pinches</b> Ross' arm)<br>
(Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! <b title='why'>How come</b> my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, honey, it's, that's a special plate. See it was-it's a game, whoever gets that plate wins.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't believe I won.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You know, this's such a slap in the face. I mean I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica is Ross' sister.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, Ross' sister was really fat.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That was me.<br>
<i>Amy</i>No, she was this really <b title='dork - a stupid person. -y - having a quality'>dorky</b> girl in high school, used to follow Rachel <b title='in or to many places or parts of an area ↗about'>around</b> like a <b title='young dog'>puppy dog</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Hey Amy, you got to stop doing that.<br>
(Amy gets <b title='pissed off - annoyed, disappointed, unhappy'>pissed</b> and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very <b title='harsh - too strong etc'>harshly</b>, you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(About to have a heart attack) Ok, uh listen I know that you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, in-in fact I think that, that everyone should, uhm, cut their food like this.<br>
(Monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat off with a knife)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Now, see, uh this way you protect the plates... and-and let's face it, you have fun.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Ok, how about this, if you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, if crazy plate lad... (sees Monica <b title='feeling annoyed, upset, and impatient, because you cannot control or change a situation, or achieve sth'>frustrated</b> at this <b title='↗remark'>comment</b>) If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?<br>
(Ross and Rachel pause and <b title='think carefully'>ponder</b> this)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, actually...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Actually what?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh... it's just, it's just in that case, then, um, Emma would go to my parents.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hurts, doesn't it?<br>
(Chandler gives a look that says "Yeah!")<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Raises his hand) Uh... who has to die for me to get her?<br>
(Everyone is looking around and at Joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Looks down) No, that, that is not what we're saying.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah he's lying. He looked down.<br>
(Joey looks to Phoebe and she nods in agreement)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well what is wrong with me? Am I ... am I <b title='not having the ability or skill to do a job properly'>incompetent</b>? Because I <b title='manage to - succeed in doing sth difficult'>managed</b> to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, you're <b title='take - accept'>taking</b> this the wrong way. We-we think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just... you-you're more the, you know, fun parent.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah and we'd want to make sure that Emma also has someone like Monica who is more of a, a <b title='↗discipline'>discliplinarin</b>, someone who can be firm and strict.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's not how you <b title='consider'>see</b> me, is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(While cutting a sweet potato in the air) No you<b title='be all about - be extremely enthusiastic for'>'re all about</b> the fun.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, you-you both are equally capable. It's-it's just... you're strongest when, when you're together.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. So if we both had Emma and I died (knocks on table) she had have to give her up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure, Monica would have to give her up.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I lie better then that, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, let me, let me just <b title='↗set/put sb straight, put it this/another way'>get this straight</b>. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>There's your movie! (claps)<br>
[Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise <b title='badly'>poorly</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean it's not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of <b title='a wine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot">Wiki</a>]'>Merlot</b> and a five year old <b title='↗diaphragm'>condom</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father <b title='sb with a particular type of appearance or character ↗shape, image'>figure</b> and I never will be.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, you learn these things. You grow-<b title='develop/become sb/sth'>grow into</b> it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, but it's not who I am. You know? Everything they said is exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And it's true. And look, everybody knows it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know it! I wanna have a kid with you because I think you're gonna be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, well, can you <b title='imagine'>picture</b> me saying "Go to your room! You're <b title='ground - stop a child going out as a punishment for behaving badly'>grounded</b>"?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You said that to me last week.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.

<i>Phoebe</i>It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's simple, it's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Does it have something to do with a spaceship? Oh no no no no, the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty">Wiki</a>] ↗free woman'>Statue of Liberty</b> came to life, and...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Shhh. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.<br>

<i>Joey</i>(All nervous and looking down and <b title='fiddle - keep moving and touching sth, esp because you are bored or nervous'>fiddling</b> with his ear) Uh... my sister's raccoon...<br>

<i>Joey</i>Alright, I'll take care of it. (throws hands out in the air)<br>

(Ross walks away with a face of "yeah ok".)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>UCHH! (much louder and longer then Amy's)<br>
<i>Amy</i>You know... this is, this is <b title='typical'>classic</b> Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, yeah, right. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?<br>
<i>Amy</i>This might be my one chance to have a child, Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? What carrer?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Um... I'm a decorator.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? Ok! I went to the zoo yesterday, now I'm a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala">Wiki</a>]'>koala bear</b>.<br>

<i>Amy</i>Oh. Yeah. Well, you didn't come to see me in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I did the first time! Oh. Oh (gets up and walks into the kitchen) And you know what. You wanna know why I'm not giving Emily to you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Emma.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Turns to Ross) Oh whose side are you on? (Back to Amy) I'm not giving you Emma because there is <b title='used to tell sb that sth is impossible'>no way</b> you could handle the responibility of a child.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well how hard could it be? You do it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh...<br>
<i>Amy</i>Do I know why you don't wanna me to have the baby?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh huh.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Because you don't want me to be happy. You-you have always been jealous of me.<br>

<i>Amy</i>Uh... To name a few. You know, you just, you've always been like this. You just, you had to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in <b title='typically includes seventh and eighth grade [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_high#United_States">Wiki</a>]'>junior high</b>, when you stole Timmy from me.

<i>Amy</i>You <b title='an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. (directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table) Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.<br>
(Everyone sucks their breath in, in shock)<br>
<i>Ross walks over</i>Too far, Amy. Too far.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You take that back.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>A gig we're definitely not going to.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well <b title='used when you are changing the subject of a conversation'>anyway</b>, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, why? <b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?' / 'What happened?'">What's up</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I have an <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b> for <b title='used to mention sb/sth without giving a name ↗some'>this</b> play and for some of it I have to speak French.

<i>Monica</i>These are for Erica!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? No, no! Hey hey hey, look.<br>

<i>Ross</i>They gave him a lot of <b title='medicine or drugs given to people who are ill'>medication</b>, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we-we'll go see him <b title='at the earliest time in the day'>first thing</b> in the morning, ok?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let's go to a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre">Wiki</a>]'>Broadway</b> show. <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_%28musical%29">Wiki</a>]'>Cats</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think we've done enough.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, th-these are actors dressed like cats who sing like people. I mean, come on!<br>
<i>Erica</i>Thanks so much for showing me around.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, uh, ok, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. <b title='the player who leads a sports team'>Captain</b> of the football team, really <b title='sexually attractive ↗gorgeous, hot'>cute</b> and he got a scholarship and <b title='go off - leave a place'>went off</b> to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's great.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look <b title='↗bemused, bewildered, puzzled, perplexed'>confused</b> now)<br>
<i>Monica</i>How-how's that <b title='used in statements and questions to introduce or give emphasis to what you are saying'>now</b>?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I've only ever been with two guys, but they <b title='sort of'>sorta</b> <b title='if two activities or periods of time overlap, the second one starts before the first one has finished'>overlapped</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, what<b title='does'>'s</b> the other guy do? Does, does he go to college too?<br>
<i>Erica</i>No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wa-was he <b title='false - based on incorrect information or ideas. false imprisonment/arrest - the illegal act of putting sb in prison or arresting them for a crime they have not committed'>falsely</b> <b title='↗charge, sue, prosecute'>accused</b> of something?

<i>Monica</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All ri-oh-alright, let's <b title='suppose'>say</b> that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'd <b title='carefully watch everything that sb does, esp because you do not trust them'>keep an eye on</b> him! We have to find out which one the father is.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I <b title="don't know">dunno</b>, aren't there tests for these things, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex">Oedipus complex</a>]'>loves him mommy</b>.

<i>Phoebe</i>Really, can I hear some of it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script.

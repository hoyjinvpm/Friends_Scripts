<s>Chandler's hotel room in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma">Wiki</a>]'>Tulsa</b>. He's <b title='completely asleep'>fast asleep</b> when the telephone rings.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(picking up the telephone, answering it <b title='have a frog in your throat - have difficulty in speaking, esp because of a sore throat'>with a frog in his throat</b>) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, you're screaming.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='you can be absolutely sure that'>YOU BET YOUR ASS</b> I AM! I just had the best first day, ever! The kitchen, twice as big as Allessandro's.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='↗yarn'>yawning</b>) Oh, that's great.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(clearly not so interested) <b title='extremely impressive'>Awesome</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, and the people are so nice. There's <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> <b title='used for emphasis'>one</b> guy, Jeffrey, he's the <b title='head waiter'>maitre d'</b>, Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.</s>
<i>Mike</i>This is nice.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realizes she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to <b title='stop holding'>let go</b> of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>You need both hands for that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods <b title='feeling/showing that you enjoy sth or are pleased about it'>appreciative</b>. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Are you sure that's sweet enough?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(in a very sweet voice) Aah, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start <b title='babble - speak quickly in a way that is difficult to understand ↗stutter, stammer'>babbling</b> and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaahh (he turns away to the bar)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously <b title='very far / by a large amount'>way</b> too early for us to be... having that conversation.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Ok, when I got divorced, I-I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's <b title='chewing gum, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum">Wiki</a>] ↗bubble gum, gumball'>gum</b>. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no <b title='banknote ↗paper money, bill'>note</b>'s there...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(impatient) I know. Mike, why don't you keep digging?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.<br>
<i>Mike</i>It's to my apartment.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, I want to.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. <b title='Here you are'>Here you go</b>. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>This is cool, huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really is.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (<b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mimic, mock, simulate'>mimes</b> opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
<s>Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing a <b title="sb whose job is to take care of sb else's children">nanny</b> candidate.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start <b title='at once ↗right now'>right away</b>, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.<br>
<i>Nanny Candidate</i>(in a <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the <b title='when sth changes from one form or state to another ↗transfer, transform'>transition</b> for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?<br>
<i>Nanny Candidate</i><b title="used to say 'no' or 'not' in a less strong way ↗no way">Not really</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.<br>
<i>Nanny Candidate</i>Oh, you know, wait. I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do <b title='chosen or happening without any particular method, pattern, or purpose'>random</b> drug testing?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.<br>
<i>Nanny Candidate</i>That's <b title='ok'>cool</b>. But... but if you do, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> need three days notice.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='ok'>Okidoki</b>! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross <b title='crumple - crush sth so that it becomes smaller and bent ↗crumble, crumb'>crumples</b> up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, <b title='used to tell sb that you know that what they have just said was not true'>come on</b> Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And <b title='if the worst thing that can happen does happen [<a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9141/worse-comes-to-worst-or-worst-comes-to-worst">link</a>]'>worse comes to worse</b>, we can <b title='if everything else fails'>always</b> reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='angry'>indignant</b>) What, the blonde with no bra?<br>
<i>Ross</i>She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "<b title='I understand'>gotcha</b>" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just <b title='a very short period of time'>a sec</b>! Ok, ok. This one's name is Sandy. Uh, she's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok... (Ross opens the door.)<br>
<i>Sandy</i>(a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And she's a little <b title='-ish - typical of or like a particular type of person ↗masculine, feminine'>mannish</b>...
<s>Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>) Oh my God! David!<br>
<i>David</i>Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>! What're you doing here? Are you back from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk">Wiki</a>]'>Minsk</b>?<br>
<i>David</i>Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm-I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our <b title='thing given for a particular purpose, esp money from the government ↗corruption'>grant</b>, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Who cares, it got you here.<br>
<i>David</i>Well, it-it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and-and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow. Where is your <b title='↗baggage, carry-on'>luggage</b>? (David thinks for a while)<br>
<i>David</i>Damn it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>A-All right, well... I'll-I'll call the cab company.<br>
<i>David</i>Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? <b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it <b title='go - used to talk about what a story etc consists of'>goes</b>: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... Th-this thing that I'm looking at: wow!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> good.<br>
<i>David</i>Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> you start thinking well, come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very <b title='charm - please and interest sb ↗Prince Charming'>charmed</b>) Well, so, uhm... well, are you <b title='see - have a romantic relationship with'>seeing</b>... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No...
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe is <b title='pace - walk with regular steps in one direction and then back again, usu because you are nervous'>pacing</b> up and down the room.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe he didn't give you a chance.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, well... That'd been your window.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? Th-the scientist guy?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Continue...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. Ok, then it gets worse, <b title='because'>'cause</b> then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, isn't it <b title='odd or amusing because it involves a contrast'>ironic</b> that David would <b title='=show'>show up</b> on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastically</b>) Uhuh... Yeah! You know. And <b title='considering'>given</b> my life long search for irony, you could imagine how happy I am.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you gonna do?<br>

<i>Monica</i>You have to tell David!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
<s>The <b title='↗corridor'>hallway</b> between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What'd you know, you're a door... You just like <b title='a type of joke [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock-knock_joke">Wiki</a>]'>knock-knock jokes</b>...

<i>Monica</i>Heeeeeey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it <b title='Sooners is the name given to settlers in the midwest of the United States who entered the Unassigned Lands in what is now the state of Oklahoma... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooners">Wiki</a>]'>the Sooner state</b>. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Oklahoma_in_United_States.svg/270px-Oklahoma_in_United_States.svg.png">'>a pan handle</b>?

<i>Monica</i>No, it<b title='has'>'s</b> reminded me of something this guy did today at work. I-I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, he <b title='if a problem or difficulty comes up, it appears or starts to affect you =arise'>came up</b>...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Well, he did this <b title='a joke from a comedy routine'>bit</b>... You probably had to be there, but it was uh, <b title='Liza May Minnelli is an American actress and singer'>Laizah Minelli</b> locked in our <b title='↗fridge, refrigerator'>freezer</b>, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe <b title='If sb bursts out laughing, crying, or making another noise, they suddenly start making that noise.

<i>Sandy</i>I really <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> understand how hard it's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/<b title='having doubts ↗sceptic, skeptic, dubious, questionable, suspicious, doubtful'>sceptical</b> look and Rachel is very emotional)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sandy, that's exactly what it is...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you <b title='↗straight, lesbian, heterosexual, homosexual, come out (of the closet'>gay</b>? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross! (To Sandy) I'm sorry. That's our Ross. He's just <b title='shoot from the hip - speak directly and frankly ↗blunt'>Mr. Shoot Straight From The Hip</b>.<br>
<i>Sandy</i>It's ok. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I'm-I'm engaged actually.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Sandy</i>Her name is Deliah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, that's pretty.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sceptically) So you're-you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?<br>
<i>Sandy</i>I realise how it's... a bit <b title='=unconventional ≠orthodox ↗traditional, [<a href="Eastern Orthodox Church">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church</a>]'>unorthodox</b> for some people, but, I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is <b title='↗look after, bring up, raise'>take care of</b> a child.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on a yeah, right tone) Ok.<br>
<i>Sandy</i>Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I <b title='get to - have the opportunity to'>got to</b> watch him grow into this <b title='very good'>awesome</b> person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look <b title='confused ↗bemused, bewildered'>puzzled</b>) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... <b title='exactly'>right</b> in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to <b title='↗console, soothe, condolence'>comfort</b> him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, kids say all kinds of <b title='↗rubbish, shit'>crap</b>. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God, she must... she must need her diaper changed.<br>
<i>Sandy</i>Oh, oh, I-I can do it for her, if you want...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room)<br>
<i>Sandy</i>Uh, <b title='just want to let you know'>Just so you know</b>, these dinosaur toys, aren't really age-appropriate.<br>
<i>Ross</i>They're mine.<br>
<i>Sandy</i>Oh. Also not, age-appropriate.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh, <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, Rach, he's a guy!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't <b title='If you try sth out, you test it in order to find out how useful or effective it is or what it is like.'>try him out</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because, it's weird!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why?<br>
(Ross makes some unintelligible sounds.)
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, I never looked at it that way.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-what kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I mean it's like i-if a woman wanted to be...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗penis model'>King</b>?<br>
<i>Sandy</i>I uh... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made <b title='↗cream, cosmetic, potion'>lotion</b> on Emma. It's a mixture of <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Calendula_January_2008-1_filtered.jpg/220px-Calendula_January_2008-1_filtered.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendula">Wiki</a>] ↗chamomile, chrysanthemum'>calendula</b> and honey cream.

<i>Rachel</i>(whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" <b title='a movement of part of your body, esp your hands or head, to show what you mean'>gesture</b>) YES! Sandy you're hired.<br>
<i>Sandy</i>That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a <b title='↗masculine, girlie, sissy'>feminine</b> way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oooh... God, come here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> be at least <b title='bisexual - sexually attracted to/having the organs for both men and women'>bi</b>...

<i>Joey</i>Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm-I'm not so good with remembering <b title='line - words that an actor says in a play etc'>lines</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica says that her maitre d' is the funniest guy she's ever met.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Seriously? She actually said that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ye.... (stops because he realizes what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi! There you are.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a-a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...<br>
<i>David</i>No... no...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)<br>
<i>David</i>In Minsk...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>David</i>...it's uhm... it's-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yes... What is the end of that sentence?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, so?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really? Do you not know Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is that why he's acting so weird? He's jealous? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey!<br>

<i>Monica</i>I don't know... It's-It's... well it's just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)<br>

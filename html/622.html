<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='unhappy, disappointed, or sad ↗oppressed, depressed'>dejected</b>) Hi, you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well it's just- it's one of those situations that I just hate. You know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Library_and_Museum">Wiki</a>'>the Morgan Chase museum</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(nodding <b title='in a way that shows you know or understand sth'>knowingly</b>) Now you're thinking you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> sleep with him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll give up my ticket.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, that's so generous!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And I think Ross is generous too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Great! Ok then it's just us girls!<br>
<i>Monica and Rachel</i>(less than enthused) Great.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So what-what is the exhibit.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's mostly just photographs of, um <b title='↗heterosexual, gay, come out (of closet), homosexual'>lesbian</b> love scenes <b title='intersperse - mix one thing in with another in an irregular way ↗scatter'>interspersed</b> with video games and free sandwiches.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh <b title='used an interjection'>man</b>! (Hits Chandler)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi <b title='used when calling to sb or greeting them'>there</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Ross, listen, Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh that's great!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean think about all the money that you're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> make!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why? What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, you know, <b title='stop worrying or thinking too much about sth ↗obsessive, fixate'>let it go</b>, stop it! Besides, Rachel is <b title='↗ask out, flirt, hit on, date'>going out</b> with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in <b title='preserved bones or shells'>fossils</b>, huh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean Ross all that does is <b title='↗ring a bell'>remind</b> us that you are interested in fossils.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok. Uh, well uh, Rachel is gonna need to <b title="to whisper sweet nothings in sb's ear means to talk softly and lovingly to them, while holding them close, and letting them know how much you love them. Paul is too old to hear whispers. ↗pillow talk, small talk">yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear</b>.<br>
(And walks up right behind Ross, and standard <b title='situation comedy'>sitcom</b> joke 2B follows with the person being insulted standing right behind the person doing the insulting while the rest of the people become <b title='↗scared, terrified, horrified'>frightened</b> and try to warn the insulter about the <b title='↗employ, employer, employee"'>insultee</b>'s presence.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, come on, you guys, that's funny! You know? <b title='because'>'Cause</b> he's gonna need- he's got like a <b title='a small piece of equipment that sb wears in their ear to help them hear'>hearing aid</b> you know, 'cause-'cause you know, 'cause he's <b title='used for emphasis'>all</b> old, and...<br>
(Paul reveals his presence by laughing, thus <b title='conclude - complete, end, finish'>concluding</b> standard sitcom joke 2B. Paul then pulls Ross aside to have a little chat with him and tells the rest of the group that he'll just be one second.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>Ok look, Ross, <b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b>, since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really? That ok, that's great.<br>
<i>Paul</i>Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, I don't want you seeing my daughter <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.<br>
<i>Paul</i>Yes it does.<br>
<i>Ross</i>But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.<br>
<i>Paul</i>I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh! A man with a plan!

(The dry cleaner finishes with the customer in front of Joey and they approach the counter.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! So I'm back.<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>Who are you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn't <b title='↗recall, recollection, memorize, learn by heart, ring a bell'>remember</b>) Ok, maybe this will <b title='make you remember sth'>jog your memory</b>, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Ok eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Oh well, it's not on TV yet.<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>Well, then it's not on the wall yet.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So umm, <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>now</b>, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?<br>
(The dry cleaner just stares at her and she retreats.)
<s>The Morgan Chase Museum, the girls are entering.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I love museums!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Where do you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> start?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> lunch.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, wow. What do you think, maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! No! Why?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?<br>
(A museum official enters with another man and woman.)<br>
<i>The Museum Official</i>(to the couple) And you can put the <b title='a passage between rows of seats ↗window seat'>aisle</b> over here (points), and then have the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I do not know you could get married here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) You-you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch">Wiki</a>]'>arch</b>. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)<br>
<i>The Museum Official</i>(To Monica) May I help you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?<br>
<i>The Museum Official</i>Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry! (She <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> storms out with the couple.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, you should totally <b title='↗write down/out, fill out/in'>put your name down</b> for this place.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> you get engaged in two years and then you've <b title='got to'>gotta</b> wait another two years for this place? That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, you know? Someone, someone who <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah and honey, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean if in two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm gonna do it too!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Me too!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? Who would, who would you marry?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know, I don't have anyone <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>. You know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Pheebs.<br>

<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>I did.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, let's get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>No! It don't go up on the wall!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? But you saw the show!<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>Yes, it was very offensive to my people!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dry cleaners?<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>Russians! It showed them as terrorists and <b title='villain - the main bad character in a film etc ↗hero'>villains</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok! Ok, look! You-you-you got <b title='an American film actor and producer. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford">Wiki</a>]'>Harrison Ford</b> up there!<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!<br>

<i>Ross</i>This place is really beautiful!<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes- Do-do you wanna <b title='kissing and touching each other in a sexual way'>make out</b>?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Sure!<br>
(They fall to the couch and start to make out, but Ross stops <b title='all of a sudden'>suddenly</b>.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>No. No-no uh, he just, he just really <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked me out</b> <b title='at an earlier time ↗then'>before</b>.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. <b title='used for showing that you do not think that sth is very good or impressive'>Big deal</b>. Besides, we find it fun hiding it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
(They start making out again.)<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>(quietly) Hey, umm, you brought <b title='condom'>protection</b>, right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot. I can't believe I brought two cans of bug <b title='a container which forces liquid out in a stream of small drops ↗fog'>spray</b> and forgot that.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.<br>

<i>Elizabeth</i>(laughs) I'll be back in ten minutes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh, ok.<br>

<i>Monica</i>The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad is this?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well for the regular guy, it's bad, with Chandler, Oh dear God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! I know! And he totally <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked out</b> and I can't find him anywhere!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wh-what are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's <b title='certain to be true'>for sure</b>! (<b title='mimic =imitate'>Mimicking</b> her.) "You know, what harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel said that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well Rachel's not here! (Runs out.)
<s>Outside. Joey and Phoebe are walking to the Dry Cleaner's.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>You really think she put your picture up already?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Did she put my picture up? You kidding, after the <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> we had? I wouldn't be surprised if she put 10 of my pictures up there. Except for the fact that I only gave her one. I don't know where she would get the other nine.<br>
(Phoebe and Joey enter the Dry Cleaner's.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a <b title='an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>(entering) Son of a bitch!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, maybe ask this guy.<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>You, get out of my shop!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, what did he do?<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>He went out with my wife!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I- Hey-hey, I did not go out with your wife! (The same woman from before enters.) Ok? I went out with her! (Points at her.)<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>That's my wife!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(nervously) Um-um-um, I'm not pointing to her, no. I'm pointing at-at her. (To a picture off screen) "Zelda McMurray." Who the hell? How did she get up there?!<br>
<i>The Dry Cleaner</i>Get out! (Starts yelling at him in Russian, and I'm betting he's not saying pleasant things about him.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, we should go.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.
<s>Paul's Bedroom, Elizabeth is entering.</s>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ross? Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Elizabeth! (He opens one of the <b title='a small table, chest, etc for use next to a bed. Also called bed/bedside table, night table, nightstand'>bedstands</b> that he has curled himself up into.) Ok. Ok. (She helps him out.) I'm gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, ok?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another <b title='a sweet fizzy drink'>soda</b>!<br>
(Ross <b title='frantical - almost out of control'>frantically</b> starts to open the window as Paul enters and traps him halfway out the window.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>Ross!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God Ross! What <b title='↗the hell'>in heaven's name</b> are you doing here?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot <b title='have a romantic relationship with'>see</b> each other anymore.<br>
<i>Paul</i>Ross. You and I are gonna have to have a little talk.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Daddy!<br>
<i>Paul</i>You're next!<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ok. I didn't know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>Let me just see if I <b title='get sth straight - understand the facts of a situation and be able to tell them correctly ↗set/put sb straight'>got this straight</b>. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard, was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, please-please Paul, just let me explain...<br>
<i>Paul</i>No, let me explain! Fired!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not, <b title='used for emphasis, completely'>all</b> that different. I mean, I <b title='↗also, as well'>too</b> am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>(<b title='↗panicking, mimicked'>panicked</b>) What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>And I too, am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul's flexing.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is <b title='pace - walk with regular steps in one direction and then back again, usu because you are anxious or worried'>pacing</b>, waiting for Chandler to return. Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(going over to him) I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, we were at <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Right here! (<b title='↗quack, meow, purr, woof, bark'>Clucks</b> like a chicken for some reason.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, please don't think I was trying to <b title='try to make sb do sth by forcing, threatening, or persuading them in a determined way'>pressure</b> you. Phoebe and Rachel just thought...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It was a mistake. Please don't <b title='consider'>take</b> this to mean anything, because it doesn't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! I know.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (They <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, I'm gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you're back. I was really worried about you. And you know that guy that never delivered his <b title='a Mexican dish made with a tortilla (=flat thin bread) folded around meat or beans with cheese [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito">Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-Papa_chevos_burrito-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Papa_chevos_burrito.jpg/250px-Papa_chevos_burrito.jpg"> ↗tortilla, taco'>burrito</b>? He thought there was some sort of connection. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering from her room) Hey, did she <b title='believe sth that sb tells you'>buy</b> it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Totally.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So did Heldi show you the place?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, it's beautiful.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't believe you're gonna <b title='↗propose, engagement'>ask Monica to marry you</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.<br>
(They hug.)
<s>Central Perk, Joey is going up to the counter.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Gunther.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Hey! Take these <b title='cappuccino - Italian coffee made with hot milk and with chocolate powder on top [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino">Wiki</a>] ↗espresso, mocha, latte'>cappuccinos</b> to table 11 and that guy over there (points) wants the <b title='twice-baked biscuits originating in the Italian city of Prato.

<i>Joey</i>Oh uh, well I just actually came in for a cup of coffee <b title='↗for here, takeaway, takeout'>to go</b>.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Do you still work here?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Oh <b title='used to say that you agree with sth, that you understand it, or that it does not annoy you'>that's cool</b>, I was gonna fire you anyway.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)<br>

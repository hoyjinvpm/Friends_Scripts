Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for <b title='start over - start doing sth again from the beginning'>starting your life over</b>. Number five: how great you are with Ben.<br>
(Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter, <b title='↗puzzled, bemused, perplexed, bewildered'>confused</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Number six: the way you smell.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(opens the drapes) Hey, Ross! What're you doing?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah, Wait.<br>
(He opens the window, Ross comes in, <b title='very wet'>soaked</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are you doing out there?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am, uh, I am...<br>
<i>Monica</i>My <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice <b title='very hot'>steaming</b> cup of hot Mockolate?<br>
(Ross runs to Rachel's bedroom, knocking on the door.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on. You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> give me another chance.<br>
(Rachel opens the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's what I said.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, maybe we should go?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, come on, look, I know how you must-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(near tears) No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, but, but, see, I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, that's, that's <b title='very'>mighty</b> <b title='generous'>big</b> of you, Ross. (to the others) I said don't go!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? You know what? If things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not wanna be with you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.<br>
(She closes the door in his face. Ross walks <b title='sullen - showing that you are in an unhappy mood'>sullenly</b> back to the couch and sits down. A moment of silence <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(quietly) I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? (Ross stares blankly at him) Maybe a little longer.

<i>Monica</i>Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/MeasuringSpoons.jpg/250px-MeasuringSpoons.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablespoon">Wiki</a>]'>tablespoon</b> of mockolate.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Sure, what? Ok, ok. (hangs up the phone) (to Rachel) Music?<br>
(Monica turns on the radio.)<br>

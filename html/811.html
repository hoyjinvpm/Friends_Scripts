<i>Phoebe</i>That guy back there? He's <b title='very'>awfully</b> short and I-I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? Oh, what is wrong with me <b title='recently'>lately</b>? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look- hey- (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>, with the way I'm feeling, all I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> do is rip off his <b title='loose pants made of thick cotton that you wear for exercising or relaxing ↗jersey, sneaker'>sweatpants</b> and <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Red_Fanny_Pack.jpg/175px-Red_Fanny_Pack.jpg"> a small bag with a belt that you wear around your waist [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_pack">Wiki</a>]'>fanny pack</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!<br>

<i>Doug</i>Well, give it time. So, the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't think of anything we're doing. (Quietly) Why can't I think of anything we're doing?<br>
<i>Doug</i>Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.

<i>Chandler</i>Honey, once you get to know him, he's much, much worse. I can't do this alone.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, I'm sorry, I cannot help you, I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's because he wasn't invited, all right? Because of the way he behaved at our <b title='an agreement between two people to marry'>engagement</b> party.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Huh. Wow, that's- this is great.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess it's ok to say it to other people.<br>
<i>Mona</i>How many did you want? I'm getting a hundred.<br>
<i>Ross</i>A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh...I don't, I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, the card thing.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Really? Why not?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.<br>
<i>Mona</i>You know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Where are we?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Mona</i>You know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hmm...<br>
<i>Mona</i>I mean, I love spending time with you, you know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Let's do the card!<br>
<i>Mona</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The card! I think we're there!<br>
<i>Mona</i>Ok. I-But I still think we should have this conversation.<br>

<i>Monica</i>You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, we're not just doing a card! You know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ugh! Women!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh Ross? You asked me that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! You were a closed book! Ok? I'm not a mind reader!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well what're you gonna say to her? I mean, where is this relationship going?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I don't know, I mean I really like her, and I wanna keep dating her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So tell her that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I can't. Beause then she's gonna say "Well if it's not moving anywhere, then-then-then, we should just <b title='end relationship'>break up</b>."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah that's true.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Tell you, <b title='↗plus'>besides</b>, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really!

You know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Like asking her to move in with you?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Give her a key to your apartment.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixtape.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but oh, I could say I looove spending time with you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, we hate that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That is a slap in the face.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh forget it. I-I-You know what? I-I'll just, I'll have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and-and hope for the best. What'd you think Rach?<br>

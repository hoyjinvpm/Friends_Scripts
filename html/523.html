<i>Monica</i>It was, it was really nice. And we started talking and I-I <b title='end up - reach or come to a certain place, state or action'>ended up</b> having lunch with him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh that is so weird! I had a dream that you had lunch with Richard.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But again, Richard Simmons. Go on.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw. Because it would totally <b title='freak sb out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak him out</b> and tomorrow's our <b title='a date which is remembered or celebrated because a special event happened on that date in a previous year'>anniversary</b>. I just don't want anything to spoil that.<br>

<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>On a totally different bet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's almost our anniversary!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>We have to?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok but this is great, but, Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, he just doesn't want us to <b title='experience sth, esp sth unpleasant'>go through</b> any trouble.

<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course you could take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, but I've got tickets to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh">Wiki</a>]'>Van Gogh</b> exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(coughing) Art lover!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What'd you say?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I said art lover.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Is that supposed to be an insult?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know, I'm very tired.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That sounds great.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Yeah, you know, that'll be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah, so you can walk around naked.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! So I can be <b title='↗alone, lonely, on my own'>by myself</b>. You know? Have a little alone time.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah uh-huh, naked alone time.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
<s>An airplane cabin, Phoebe has the <b title='a passage between rows of seats ↗window seat'>aisle</b> seat, Chandler the window, and Monica's stuck in that horrible middle seat.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, <b title='until now'>so far</b>, is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So far it's <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> the same Pheebs.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her <b title='handbag'>purse</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh-ha! Ok, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> back. (Gets up and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> <b title='in or toward the back part of a ship or plane ≠fore ↗stern, bow, rear'>aft</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aww! I love you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Can I give you a present now?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ok! (He grabs his <b title='a bag that you are allowed to take onto an aircraft with you ↗baggage, luggage'>carry-on</b> and starts <b title='rummage - search for sth ↗grope'>rummaging</b> through it.) Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>! Don't tell me I did this!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love the "I forgot the present" <b title='trick'>fake out</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How do you feel about the, "I really <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, honey, that's ok. Don't worry about it, you give it to me when we get back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, this's the worst thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(sitting down) Oh good! All right, you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What-what Richard thing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, no. [The patented version.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What Richard thing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! <b title='go - say'>Go</b> Simmons!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to <b title='like, choose'>go for</b> <b title='a small meal'>a bite</b> and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't wanna spoil our anniversary.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you <b title='ran into'>bumped into</b> Richard!

But then realizes she didn't have to do that. So she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks about it for a little while and...</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! (Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.

(In her head.) Huh, <b title='look at me'>check me out</b>! I'm in my kitchen... naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked!

She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Ho-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?<br>
[Cut back to Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel is singing along with a song and dancing while facing the big picture window. You know, I think I'd pay real good money to be on the other side of that window!]<br>

(Ross keeps giggling and Rachel decides upon <b title='harm done to sb as a punishment for harm that they have done to sb else ↗avenge'>revenge</b>. She gets up and kisses the rather large man in the seat in front of Ross on the back of his head. The guy turns around angrily.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross! What're you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.<br>
[Time lapse, Ross is drinking something and decides to get Rachel again.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! You know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)<br>
[Time lapse, Rachel pushes the <b title='sb who serves passengers on a plane ↗stewardess'>flight attendant</b> call button, takes Ross's drink, and spills it into his lap.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>What the? What...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there.

<i>Drunken Gambler</i>It went under the table.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nobody move! (To Chandler) Ok, you look that way; I'll look this way!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right!<br>
(He searches to his right; she searches to her left. They're both on their hands and knees when they spot the <b title='a dice'>die</b>. It's propped up against the table leg, and it's not lying flat. Both the four and the five are showing.)<br>

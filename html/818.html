<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Ross, Mon, is it ok if I bring someone to your parent's <b title='a date when you celebrate sth that happened in a previous year'>anniversary</b> party?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure. Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who's the guy?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, his name is Parker, and I met him at the drycleaner's.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oooh, did he put a little <b title='a white substance without any taste that is found in rice, potatoes etc =carbohydrate ↗sperm stain'>starch</b> in your <b title='underwear that women wore in the past, like loose trousers that end at the knees'>bloomers</b>? (Sits up) Who said that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, he's really great though. He has this <b title='extremely good, large, or great'>incredible</b> <b title='enthusiasm'>zest</b> for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be ok if I gave the <b title='the act of raising a glass and drinking in honor of or to the health of sb/sth'>toast</b> to mom and dad this year?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I'd really like to.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, hopefully this time mom won't <b title="shout 'boo' to show that you do not like a person, performance, idea etc">boo</b> you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really <b title='making sb feel emotional ↗touching'>moving</b>, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> make them cry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And you-you wonder why Ross is their favorite?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." You know what they're gonna say this year? "God, you."<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to himself) You know, I'm an actor, and any actor <b title="deserving of one's pay. Salt used to be expensive...

<i>Chandler</i>What're you doing?<br>

<i>Parker</i>What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C...I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here.

<i>Phoebe</i>Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. You know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>He's just such a great guy, I'm so excited about him.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey, you know, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him, he-he's a good guy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You think?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. You know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're right. You're right, he's just <b title='embrace - hug'>embracing</b> life. We could all <b title='take up positions for action'>stand to</b> be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.<br>
<i>Joey</i>A-actually, you have a little bit of an <b title='advantage'>edge</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's that <b title='used when asking for information'>now</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh look it's Parker!<br>
<i>Parker</i>Look! The <b title='a dance [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny_hop_%28dance%29">Wiki</a>]'>bunny hop</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oooh I love it!<br>
<i>Parker</i>You do?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!<br>
(Cut to Monica, at the microphone)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok it's time for the toast! Umm, I-I know that <b title='usually ↗abnormal'>normally</b> Ross gives the toast, but this year I'm gonna do it.<br>
(Everyone sighs)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No no, it-it- it's gonna be great. Really! Um, ok. Mom, dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure that I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and for so many other things I wanna say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but, I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I'm-I'm <b title='sadden - make sb feel sad ↗strengthen, weaken, -en (make sth have a particular quality)'>saddened</b> by the thought of those who could not be with us. <b title='grandmother'>Nana</b>, my <b title='loved very much by sb'>beloved</b> grandmother who would so wanna be here, but she can't, because she's dead. <b title='in the same way'>As</b> is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember, um, she's dead. Ok, her and Nana, <b title='↗pass away'>gone</b>. Wow! Um, hey, does anybody remember when <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debra_Winger">Wiki</a>]'>Debra Winger</b> had to say goodbye to her-her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You wanna hear something sad? Uh, <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> I was watching <b title='an American TV newsmagazine program [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes">Wiki</a>]'>60 Minutes</b> and there was this <b title='a short article in a newspaper or magazine or part of a television or radio program that is about a particular subject'>piece</b> on these <b title='orphan - a child whose parents have died'>orphans</b> in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Wiki</a>]'>Romania</b>, who've been so <b title='neglect - fail to look after sb/sth properly'>neglected</b>, that they are incapable of love.

You people are made of stone! <b title="used before drinking a toast in order to wish sb success or happiness.">Here's to</b> mom and dad! <b title='used to indicate indifference to or scorn for sth'>Whatever</b>!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>(looking at the picture) Why don't I <b title='↗recall, recollection, ring a bell'>remember</b> this dog?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>You're not gonna say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...uh, <b title='representing; instead of'>on behalf of</b> my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll <b title='consider as'>count</b> ourselves the luckiest people in the world.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(crying) Oh Ross...<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I just wish nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
<s>Phoebe's apartment, Parker and her are entering.</s>
<i>Parker</i>My God, what a fantastically well <b title='light - provide light for a place'>lit</b> <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Can I um get you something to drink? Like a water and <b title='commonly used to treat anxiety etc [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valium">Wiki</a>]'>Valium</b>?<br>
<i>Parker</i>I must say you know this apartment, it's, it's, there are no words.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh thank God.<br>
<i>Parker</i>It's a <b title='a safe or peaceful place ↗heaven'>haven</b>. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden">Wiki</a>] ↗Adam, Eve'>Eden</b> <b title='among, surrounded by'>in the midst</b>...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? <b title='I understand'>I got you</b>, ah, yeah. Listen, let's, uh, why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly.<br>
<i>Parker</i>That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. Let's-let's try something else, let's play a game.<br>
<i>Parker</i>I love games!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Shocking! Um, let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (<b title='giggle - laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way'>Giggles</b>)<br>
<i>Parker</i>Or...<b title='a game [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Wiki</a>]'>Jenga</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Let's-let's play this one first. And remember, whoever talks first, loses!<br>
(They sit back)<br>
<i>Parker</i>I lose, now Jenga.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Oh my God!<br>
<i>Parker</i>Is something wrong?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million <b title='fairy - an imaginary creature with magical powers, usu represented as a very small person with wings ↗Tinker Bell <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/TinkerbellDisney.jpg">'>fairies</b>? They were just brake lights, Parker!<br>
<i>Parker</i>Well, excuse me for <b title='put - express in particular way'>putting</b> a good <b title='a distinctive point of view'>spin</b> on a traffic jam!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But-but, you don't have to put a good spin on everything.<br>
<i>Parker</i>I'm sorry, that's who I am. I'm a positive person.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! I am a positive person. You are like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus">Wiki</a>]'>Santa Claus</b> on <b title='an antidepressant ↗depress [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine">Wiki</a>]'>Prozac</b>, at <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland'>Disneyland</b>, <b title='get laid - have sex'>getting laid</b>!<br>
<i>Parker</i>So, what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, you want me to be less happy?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Much less happy!<br>
<i>Parker</i>Fine! Well then to <b title='repeat exactly what sb else has said or written ↗recite'>quote</b> Ross, "I'd better be going."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='goodbye'>So long</b>! Hey! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)<br>
(There's a knock on door, and Phoebe opens it.)<br>
<i>Parker</i>Isn't this the most incredible <b title='argument'>fight</b> you've ever had in your entire life?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh huh. (Closes door)

<i>Rachel</i>Ross, it just wouldn't 've been <b title='possible or likely to succeed ↗practical, sensible, reasonable'>feasible</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>But having a <b title='↗<a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_8179995_differences-between-dove-pigeon.html">Differences Between a Dove & a Pigeon</a>'>dove</b> place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It was really fun being married to you tonight.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 <b title='dollars'>bucks</b> I've ever made.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That proposal, at the planetarium...<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know, I know it was stupid.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was, it was...really wonderful! Did you just <b title='make sth up - pretend that sth is true in order to deceive sb'>make that up</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nah, actually I thought about it when, when we were <b title='go out - have a romantic relationship with sb'>going out</b>. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow. Wow, that would've been, that would've been very hard to say no to.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, it's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) <b title='ok'>K</b>, good night<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Good night.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Uh, even if the sidecar had a, had a <b title='↗windshield, wiper'>windscreen</b> so your hair wouldn't get <b title='mess up - make sth dirty or not neat'>messed up</b>?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, <b title='used to tell sb that you know that what they have just said was not true'>come on</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we <b title='used for emphasis'>did</b> learn a lot from mom and dad. And that picture of Chi-Chi with her <b title='a mischievous person, esp a child, enjoys having fun by causing trouble ↗naughty, practical joke'>mischievous</b> <b title='a big smile that shows your teeth'>grin</b>. And what you said about nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.<br>

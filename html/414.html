<i>Rachel</i>Well, I didn't see Joshua, but, I did <b title='hit'>punch</b> a girl in the face.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The whole night was horrible, it was <b title="↗it's raining cats and dogs">pouring down rain</b>, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh! So, did you <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> meet her?<br>

<i>Monica</i>So you hit her in the face?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, she was already in, but then this big <b title='an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b> behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I <b title='hit sb, esp on the head or face'>clocked</b> her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was just a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Going over to <b title='↗console, soothe, condolence, take it easy'>comfort</b> her) Aww, Pheebs.<br>

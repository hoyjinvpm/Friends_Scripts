<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey stuffing 15 <b title='a sandwich cookie consisting of two chocolate disks with a sweet cream filling in between. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo">Wiki</a>]'>Oreos</b> in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey <b title='mumble - speak unclearly ↗incoherently, unintelligible, incomprehensible'>mumbles</b>, no!)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, where were you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, on a <b title='romantic meeting ↗hit on, ask out, go out, move in, break up, dump, get over'>date</b>. Yeah, I met <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b>this</b> girl on the train going to a museum <b title='in the northern part of a state in the U.S. ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_york_state">the state of New York</a>] <img src="270px-New_York_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/New_York_in_United_States.svg/270px-New_York_in_United_States.svg.png">'>upstate</b>.<br>
(Simultaneously)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, which museum?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(just Phoebe) No, answer his.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally <b title='unable to do anything to protect herself from me'>at my mercy</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Were you so late because you were burying this woman?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I'm getting back now because she lives in <b title='a city in the state of New York, U.S. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poughkeepsie">Wiki</a>] <img src="400px-Poughkeepsie_from_across_Hudson_River-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Poughkeepsie_from_across_Hudson_River.jpg/400px-Poughkeepsie_from_across_Hudson_River.jpg">'>Poughkeepsie</b>. She seems really great, but she's like, two and a half hours away.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie?

<i>Joey</i>Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now huh? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, <b title='↗check it out'>look at this</b>! (Holding a newspaper) They're lighting the big <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Wiki</a>]'>Christmas</b> tree tonight.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, that paper's two weeks old.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! Aw, I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, you know, at least you have somebody to miss that <b title='things'>stuff</b> with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day">Wiki</a>]'>Valentine's Day</b>, then my birthday, then bang! before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (Hearing this, Gunther moves in) You know, I want a man! (Gunther leaves <b title='↗dejected'>depressed</b>) I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, you know, just like a <b title='a short and not very serious sexual relationship'>fling</b> would be great.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, let me tell you something, it's been a long time since I've been <b title='past tense of fling (throw)'>flung</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I know <b title='↗vibrator'>what</b> I'm giving you for Christmas.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what? There's some nice guys at my office, you want me to <b title='arrange for two people to meet ↗fix up'>set you up</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. <b title='why'>How come</b> you never offered this <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to <b title="accept the bother of doing sth">go out of my way</b> to stop others from being happy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like <b title='↗lawyer, attorney, counsel'>legal</b>. I don't like guys with boring jobs.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh and Ross was like what? A lion <b title='tame - train a wild animal '>tamer</b>?<br>
(Monica enters)<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's wrong Mon?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Is it because of the review you wrote or something new? (Monica looks at him.) It's the review.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I thought I was <b title='make headway - make progress'>making headway</b>, everyone was smiling at me all day, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (Puts on her chef hat) on my chef's hat. (The hat says '<b title='leave a job ↗fire, lay off'>Quit</b>, <b title='an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>')<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey honey! What's the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, just trying to be nice! Whoa!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean I have not been <b title='pick on - behave in an unfair way to sb, such as by blaming them or criticizing them unfairly'>picked on</b> this much since I was in <b title='↗grade/primary/elementary school'>kindergarten</b> and they had to bring in someone from <b title='a school in the US for children who are 12 to 15 years old'>junior high</b> to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica <b title='↗stare, gaze, glimpse, glance'>glares</b> at him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohhh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at <b title='a fight or argument'>confrontation</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> director, I think it was <b title='1915 – October 10, 1985 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Wells">Wiki</a>]'>Orson Wells</b>, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who is boss.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's a good idea! Uh, do you know how to waiter?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Good enough to <b title='make sb become'>get</b> fired.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, you're hired!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct <b title="a global chain of hamburger fast food restaurants (often abbreviated as BK).

<i>Chandler</i>I say, Drew! Are you <b title='be seeing sb - be having a romantic relationship with sb'>seeing</b> anybody <b title='at the present time ↗right away, by now'>right now</b>? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... you know, I'm-I'm not <b title='↗homosexual, straight, lesbian, come out (of the closet)'>gay</b>, I'm not <b title='↗hit on, go out, date, move in, dump, break up, get over'>asking you out</b>. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!<br>
<i>Drew</i>I didn't think you were gay. I do now.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she, wants to be set up.<br>
<i>Drew</i>Ahh, you know, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you know what, that might be ok even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, <b title='sexy'>hot</b> Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh wow! I'm free for her!<br>
<i>Drew</i>Wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the <b title='New York Rangers, a National Hockey League team [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers">Wiki</a>]'>Ranger</b> game tomorrow?<br>

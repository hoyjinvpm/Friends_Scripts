<i>Monica</i>Think about it.<br>
(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Joey makes an "I don't <b title='understand'>get</b> it" shrug. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>OK, I'm guessing this is from...<br>
(Melanie <b title='↗grin, wriggle'>smiles</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, thank you, Melanie.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pointing out a gift) OK, this one <b title='exactly'>right</b> here is from me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it <b title='rattle - shake and make a quick series of short sounds ↗rattlesnake'>rattles</b>... it's...

(Chandler looks <b title='unhappy, disappointed, or sad ↗depressed, distressed, oppressed, melancholy'>dejected</b>. Rachel picks up another gift.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's <b title="an American writer, poet, and cartoonist most widely known for children's picture books [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss'>Wiki</a>]">Dr. Seuss</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Rachel) That book got me through some <b title='difficult'>tough</b> times.<br>
<i>Melanie</i>There is a little child inside this man!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.<br>
(Rachel picks up the next gift.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who's this from?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, that's Ross's.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Remembered what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It was like months ago. We were walking by this <b title='↗historical, historic'>antique</b> store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's so pretty. This must've cost him <b title='a lot of money ↗cost an arm and a leg'>a fortune</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe he did this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='exclamation indicating the belief that sth should have been considered obvious to sb else'>Come on</b>, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?<br>
(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just <b title='spill the beans - tell sth that sb else wanted you to keep a secret'>spilled the beans</b> about Ross's <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What did you just say?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='↗panic, panicking, mimic, mimicked'>panicked</b>) ahem... um... Crystal duck.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='stutter - speak with difficulty ↗stammer'>stuttering</b> <b title='not expressed or organized clearly ↗unintelligible, incomprehensible, tongue-tied'>incoherently</b>) F-hah.... flennin....<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(rubbing his <b title='temple - one of the two fairly flat areas on each side of your forehead'>temples</b>) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....<br>
<i>Joey</i>(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.<br>
[Time lapse]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>This is unbelievable. I mean, this is unbelievable.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. This is really, really huge.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's <b title='(of a girl, woman or her figure) small and thin'>petite</b>. It's <b title='very small ↗teeny, teeny-weeny'>wee</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh. I don't think any of our lives are <b title='at any time'>ever</b> gonna be the same ever again.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>OK, is there a <b title='make a sound less loud'>mute</b> button on this woman?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! Did-did you have any idea?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about <b title='↗go out, date'>asking me out</b>, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, wanna go out with me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, <b title='considering ↗now that'>given</b> that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross? All this time? Well, I got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(quickly) He-He's in China!<br>
<i>Joey</i>The country. (Rachel gives him a blank stare)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well did his flight leave yet?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you kidding? He's at a seat watching a woman do this. (waves arms like a <b title='female flight attendant'>stewardess</b>) He's gone.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What about the time difference?<br>
<i>Monica</i>From here to the airport?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna <b title='succeed in getting somewhere in time'>make it</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> try.</br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I-I-I don't know.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well then maybe you shouldn't go.<br>
<i>Joey</i>He's right, <b title='because'>'cause</b> if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that he can wait.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Here, look, all right, does this help?<br>
(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. You know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)<br>

(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)<br>

(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)<br>

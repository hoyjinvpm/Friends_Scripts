<i>Monica</i>(to Joey) Oh, what's so funny?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practicing my fake laugh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. (She laughs)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What-what's so funny?<br>
(Chandler enters with a cigarette.)<br>
<i>Gunther</i>(to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh come on <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>! At least let me finish this last one.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Ok, but only if you give me a <b title='the act of breathing in smoke from your cigarette ↗inhale'>drag</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No-no, why don't you <b title='keep'>hold on to</b> that one.<br>
(He goes and sits down next to Rachel and puts a cigarette in his mouth, which Rachel takes away from him. He puts another cigarette in his mouth, and Rachel takes it away again.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, that's like the least fun game ever.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you <b title='↗addict, alcoholic'>quit</b>. (Hands him an audio <b title='a small flat plastic case containing magnetic tape [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Ghettoblaster-family-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Ghettoblaster-family.jpg/220px-Ghettoblaster-family.jpg">'>cassette</b>)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks <b title='happening one after the other in a series ↗in tow'>straight</b> and she hasn't smoked since.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pffhah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Ross) What's your problem?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond <b title='solid waste that is passed from your bowels ↗bowl, rubbish'>crap</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey, that guy did not hypnotize me! Ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh right, <b title='because'>'cause</b> you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe-out on your <b title='↗arse, ass, bottom, buttock, tush, tushy, tushie'>butt</b> cheeks.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I was trying to <b title="take sb's attention away">distract</b> attention from that poor, old woman who was trying to <b title='fill sth until it is full'>stuff</b> her breasts into the <b title='Tube socks are socks that are knitted in a single long tube, so that they have no clearly delineated heel and ankle region.'>tube socks</b>.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?<br>
<i>Frank</i>I mean, how hard can it be? You know, I mean, you know, babies, you know who doesn't want babies right? And besides you know, I never had a dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause you know, it'll be me. Right?<br>
<i>Alice</i>You know, I mean, really we do realize that there's an age difference between us.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh good! Ok. 'Cause you were <b title='↗behave, pretend'>acting</b> like you didn't.<br>

<s>Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are being lectured by Phoebe.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, (Walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) you know. You know, I don't want to be all <b title='criticizing people very quickly'>judgmental</b>, you know, but this is <b title='↗outrageous, disgusting, infamous, disgraceful, notorious, wicked, immoral'>sick</b>, it's sick and wrong!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yes. Not out loud.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pheebs, he's not a <b title='↗thought control, telepathic, sympathy, apathy, -pathy - feeling'>mind reader</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We don't know that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but if I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. (Pause) But, you guys can, please you guys <b title='persuade him not to do it ↗convince, convert'>talk him out of it</b>.<br>
<i>Ross and Joey</i>No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!<br>
<i>Ross and Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I'm gonna go get Frank. (Exits)<br>

And then, and then, you turn to me and you say, "<b title='↗nope, not really, no way'>Nah</b>, let's just hang out at your place."

<i>Chandler</i>What check thing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>As a joke, this customer at work who has a <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did it so I'd call.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete... (Quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (Pointing to the picture) Is this him?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">Wiki</a>]'>Bill Clinton</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>All we're saying is don't <b title='start doing sth without having really decided if it is the right thing to do or having considered the best way to do it'>rush into</b> anything.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, ok, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.<br>
<i>Frank</i>What, you don't think I know that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Walks out of his bedroom) All right, I'm gonna go play basketball. Or at least let the really good guys use my ball while I say "Can I play? Can I play?" (Opens the door and sees Joey's keys still in the key hole) Oh uh, Joe, you left your keys in the door.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Here you go. (Throws him his keys in a very feminine way and leaves. Both Ross and Joey look at each other in shock and Joey picks up the keys from the floor. Both Ross and Joey turn back around to talk to Frank.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>The point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time you know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, <b title='chick - a young woman'>chicks</b> <b title='like'>dig</b> that.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Ok, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, in a poem maybe.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No the <b title='used to address sb (Frank in this case'>man</b>'s right, that's what I had with Rachel.<br>
<i>Frank</i>You don't have it anymore?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I ah, I slept with someone else.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Ok, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It didn't.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Ok, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information">Now</b>, wh-what, what is that like?<br>
<i>Frank</i>It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Don't ask me, I had it and I <b title='blow - lose a good opportunity'>blew</b> it!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh, no! No!<br>
<i>Frank</i>It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Then you <b title='keep sth rather than losing it'>hold on to</b> it!!<br>

<s>Chandler and Joey's, it's after Ross and Joey's talk with Frank, and Phoebe's is finding out what happened.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Joey) You're Frank's <b title='a male friend or relative of the bridegroom who stands with him and helps him during a marriage ceremony ↗maid of honor, bridesmaid'>best man</b>?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I couldn't help it, their love is so pure.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well uh, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm the ring <b title='sb who carries sth'>bearer</b>.<br>
(As Phoebe stands there in shock and disbelief, Chandler comes out of the bathroom and walks to his bedroom. He's just got out of the shower and has the towel wrapped around himself high across his chest, and another towel wrapped around his head, like women wear towels. Joey watches Chandler, wondering what the hell he's doing.)<br>
<s>Phoebe's, Phoebe is opening the door.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_%28condiment%29">Wiki</a>]'>mustard</b> stain on it.)<br>
<i>Alice</i>Oh my God, who died on this?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-<b title='catastrophe - disaster'>tastrophe</b>, yeah. Can you help me?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>You know what, forget it. It's ruined.<br>
<i>Alice</i>Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a <b title='↗fashionable, elegant, fancy'>stylish</b> <b title='a large piece of cloth that you put loosely over a chair to cover it and make it look attractive'>throw</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.

<i>Pete</i>Ok, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.<br>

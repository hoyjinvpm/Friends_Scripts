<i>Monica</i>Hey that's great that you- so good that you had such a good time in Greece!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Ok? I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay, in, their, honeymoon, <b title='a set of rooms, esp expensive ones in a hotel'>suite</b>, with people <b title='if sb comes up to you, they come close to you, esp in order to speak to you'>coming up to</b> me <b title='continuously'>all the time</b> <b title='go - say'>going</b>, <b title='↗imitate, mock, accent'>"Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you cry?"</b> I mean, it was sooo <b title='↗embarrassing'>humiliating</b>.

<i>Chandler</i>Oh that's not true.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes it is! It is true! I went, I <b title='go after - try to get'>went after</b> Ross in stupid London.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I put on a cheerleading outfit to <b title='tempt sb to have sexual intercourse ↗entice, tempt, lure, allure'>seduce</b> Joshua.

<i>Monica</i>I like your little <b title='a piece of long hair divided into three sections that you then twist around each other =plait ↗pigtail, pony-tail, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_style">Hairstyle</a>]'>braid</b>.

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh... No, I did that for someone once. I'm-I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='↗control freak, bossy, micromanage'>I'll do it!</b><br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's fine. So Monica, you are now in charge of my love life.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I gotta <b title='↗get off'>go to work</b>.<br>
(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in amazement.

<i>Chandler</i>And uh, Rachel, great to have you back.<br>
(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is shocked.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>.) Always a pleasure. (And he <b title='strut - walk proudly with your head high and your chest pushed forwards'>struts</b> out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)

<i>Rachel</i>I mean, you know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)-<br>

<i>Rachel</i>...I mean it's my fault.<br>

<i>Monica</i>It's ok. That's ok. I-I know that you're very upset <b title='at the present time'>right now</b> ok. I know, I know that wasn't about me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Chandler) <b title='used to say that you are sure that sth is true'>I bet</b> it was about her a little.<br>
<i>Monica</i>If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to <b title="listen to sb's conversation when they do not want you to ↗listen in, eavesdrop, overhear, listen to, listen up">listen in</b>.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I guess Gunther is kind of...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Interrupting) Look the guy over there (She points at another guy and Gunther is <b title='feeling less confident and positive than before ↗inflate, strut, pump up, intimidate'>deflated</b>.) Remember? That is the guy you <b title='flirt - behave as if sexually attracted to sb, although not seriously'>flirted</b> with at the counter <b title='↗the other day/night'>that time</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Say that to him and <b title='used to say that sb is in a very good situation and is likely to be successful'>you're golden</b>. (She just glares at him.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you, and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, you know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No. I'm sorry. It's just <b title='because'>'cause</b> I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> do now is pregnant stuff, it just <b title='bum sb out - disappoint, upset, or annoy sb ↗bummer'>bums me out</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler & Joey</i>Uh we're sorry. Sorry Pheebs.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what I like to do? It sounds a little <b title='repeated too often to be funny or interesting ↗cliché'>corny</b> but sometimes when I'm bummed out, I like to just close my eyes and think about what a wonderful gift life is.<br>
(As Phoebe closes her eyes, Monica quickly grabs her pictures back and puts them away in her purse.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>See? (Phoebe opens her eyes)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh.<br>
(Rachel returns.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Doing her laundry.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What's that? (Points to the box.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into <b title='decaying leaves or other plant material used for protecting the roots of plants and improving the soil ↗manure, potpourri, pourri (French for "rotten")'>mulch</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, honey that's awful.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make <b title='a mixture of dried, naturally fragrant plant material, used to provide a gentle natural scent inside buildings, most commonly in residential settings [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potpourri">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Sa-potpourri-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Sa-potpourri.jpg/220px-Sa-potpourri.jpg">'>potpourri</b>! I think I'm gonna, go wander out in the rain for a while.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But, it's not raining.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't <b title='get a moment of luck (in difficult times)'>catch a break</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna <b title='talk out - discuss a problem thoroughly in order to solve it ↗get sth off your chest, get sth out of your system, reproductive/digestive system'>talk this thing whole out</b>. All right? Ok. (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!<br>
<i>Dave</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to <b title='used to say that you will do sth in the future but not now. raincheck - a ticket for an outdoor event, such as a sports game, that you can use again if it rains and the action stops'>take a rain check</b>, my <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b> is just really sick. Ok? Ok! Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now and that they're not gonna get any...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='poke - move or push sth through a space or opening ↗stick, prick, peek'>Poking</b> her head in) Rach? Can I talk to you just for a minute? I-I dropped some socks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is the matter with you?! Do-do you wanna fall into the trap? Do you wanna fall into the trap?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh! You did not drop any socks!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I just <b title='run into - meet sb by chance'>ran into</b> Dave he told me you <b title='blow off - to not meet sb or go to an event'>blew him off</b>! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm <b title='call the shot - be in a position of authority so that you can give orders and make decisions ↗decision maker, in charge of, up to you, hold your fire'>calling the shots</b>! I say you <b title='leave sb alone - stop annoying or upsetting sb; go away from sb'>leave Ross alone</b> and go get Dave! And what the hell were you trying to do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, <b title='at the most basic and important level ↗finally, eventually'>ultimately</b>, I was trying you know, I-I wanted...tell him you know, that I'm still in love with him.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Gasps) What?! You cannot tell him that!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why? Why not?! People love to hear that! Come on I love you. Now, wasn't that nice?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. I make the decisions, and I say no.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know what, no, you don't make my decisions because, you're fired.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" <b title='↗paradox, dilemma'>Ha</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well... (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a <b title='sth that takes your attention away from sth else ↗distraction, avert'>diversion</b> to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel! Come on! Let me in!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Poking his head out.) Having some trouble?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel locked the door.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.<br>
[Cut to inside the apartment.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, there's something I wanna talk to you about. I just need to..<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='↗thump, pound, punch'>Banging</b> on the door outside) Rachel, open this door.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Rachel) What, is it locked?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She's fine. Listen...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Still pounding outside) Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you want me to <b title='answer the door ↗Can you get the phone'>get that</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. You know what? Jus-just let her do her thing and we'll do our thing. 'Cause I really need to tell you...(Monica pounds <b title='↗all the time'>continuously</b>.)<br>
(Ross decides to open the door for her, in which she has a sock on her hand she was banging with.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for <b title='a very short period of time'>a sec</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I really need to talk to you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, then talk!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What thing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, Rachel wants to take <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(dance)">Wiki</a>]'>swing dance</b> lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never going to get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) <b title='finally be in a particular place or situation'>end up</b> hurting.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica's right, swing dancing can be <b title='difficult to deal with and needs careful attention or skill ↗tough, difficult, subtle, diplomatic, tactful'>tricky</b>. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_bear">Wiki</a>]'>teddy bears</b> I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the <b title='an act of killing a lot of people [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre">Wiki</a>] Homo sapiens - the unique species that can kill the same species in a planned, organized, massive (large-scale) way'>massacre</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm gonna do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, Rachel, ok, I know-I know you think I'm <b title='↗insane, sanity, out of your mind'>crazy</b>, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. 'Cause I bet you, you can't.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But I...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Please!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, fine.<br>
(There's a loud bang on the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, I'm in!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(In <b title='very great, extremely large'>tremendous</b> pain) All right. <b title="all right / that's cool / I'm fine with that">Good deal</b>.

<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>All</i>Hey, Rach.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So how did you find anyone that agrees with you yet?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. But you know what? I think-I think I need a male point of view. (Chandler leans in.) Joey. (Chandler leans back.) You're a man.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You got that right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title="used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information">Now</b> do you think it would be a good idea if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nope.<br>
(Phoebe enters.)<br>
<i>All</i>Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, ok, Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Umm, you know how <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and you were <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='If sb feels left out, they feel sad because they are not included in a group or activity ↗exclude, alienate'>feeling left out</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, well, we all felt really bad about that. So, we decided, that we should all take a little trip together!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Where, where? Where's the trip?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Southwest_corner_of_Central_Park%2C_looking_east%2C_NYC.jpg/240px-Southwest_corner_of_Central_Park%2C_looking_east%2C_NYC.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park">Wiki</a>]'>Central Park</b>!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>That <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right <b title='near'>by</b> my house, all right!"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I'm gonna go home and <b title='lie or sit enjoying the warmth esp of the sun'>bask</b> in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa! Ho-ho-hold on <b title='a very short period of time'>a sec</b> there, Mr. Kissey! You know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you've got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just- you know- just stop it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Makes me wanna <b title='vomit =throw up'>puke</b>! (Chandler looks at her, <b title='showing that you are confused or surprised by sth, and perhaps that you think it is rather strange and funny'>quizzically</b>.)
<s>Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with Phoebe.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Phoebe!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, Pheebs!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, woo!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, woo! Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... You know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it <b title='blow - be of poor quality, displeasing'>blew</b>. So, we thought, that this afternoon we would all go away for the whole weekend to, <b title='a city in New Jersey [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Atlantic_City_NJ_night-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Atlantic_City_NJ_night.jpg/220px-Atlantic_City_NJ_night.jpg">'>Atlantic City</b>!<br>

(They all go pack except for Ross.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. Come on Rach, let's go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know what, that doesn't matter.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Again, I-I don't care.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as Ross sits down to read the paper.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='What are ya (you)'>Whatcha</b> reading?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Paper.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, what's it about?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Events from around <b title='the world'>the globe</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Uhh, Ross, you know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's been saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I-I think they're wrong. I mean, you know how people can be wrong.<br>

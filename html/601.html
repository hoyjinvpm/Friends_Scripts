<i>Chandler</i>I just don't think that Monica and I are ready to get married yet! You know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. You know? And, how do I tell her without <b title='crush - make sb feel extremely upset or shocked'>crushing</b> her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.<br>

(Rachel turns to Ross stunned.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(slightly hits Ross) What is the matter with you?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(not quite sure) You did.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! Wh- Hello! We didn't get married.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!<br>
(They turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get married.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>We-we-we- I remember being in a chapel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='used as an interjection'>my</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We did- They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hell, I'm drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can't have a <b title='a glass of a mixture of champagne and orange juice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosa_%28cocktail%29">Wiki</a>]'>mimosa</b> with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you guys gonna do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah-yeah. That guy's finally gonna be able to <b title='install that pool (with the money that he charged)'>put in that pool</b>. (Both Chandler and her laugh.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, oh, that's your thing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your thing. Your thing. You know? That you're the guy who gets divorced.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes you do! This is your third divorce! Huh, you love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I'm so drunk.

<i>Chandler</i>You wanna play some <b title='a Chinese gambling game [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pai_gow">Wiki</a>]'>Pai gow</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe. But I-I kind of think we should talk about last night.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's a good idea. Because I-I-I wanna talk about last night too... and I don't know what Pai Gow is.<br>
<i>Monica</i> I see. So, what do you think we should do?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know I love you! (They <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So where are we, on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That-that's a good question. Umm, well, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should <b title='leave it (up) to sb to do sth - let sb else decide sth or be responsible for sth'>leave it up to</b> <b title='↗destiny'>fate</b> again. I love you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign!

<i>Monica</i>Ready?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ready!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(sarcastic) Come on eight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='pretending to be serious'>deadpan</b>) Yes, yes eight.<br>

<i>Croupler</i>Eight! <b title='not 4 and 4'>Easy eight</b>. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they're <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That wasn't a <b title='4 + 4'>hard eight</b>! Last night I rolled a hard eight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damn it! Uh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh! I wanted it so <b title='badly - to a great or serious degree'>bad</b>! (Pause) you wanna go pack?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. (They go pack.) We're doing the right thing, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the <b title='↗escalator, lift'>elevators</b>.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.)

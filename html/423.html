<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to London and Monica comes running in.</s>
<i>Monica</i>You guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be <b title='↗traffic jam'>traffic</b>! The plane could leave early! When we <b title='arrive somewhere'>get to</b> London, there could be a <b title='queue'>line</b> at customs! <b title='tell sb to hurry'>Come on</b>!! (She runs back to her apartment.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What do you got there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='condom - a thin rubber bag that a man wears over his sex organ during sex [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom">Wiki</a>] ↗penis, diaphragm'>Condoms</b>, <b title='used to address sb'>dude</b>!<br>
<i>Joey (Looks at the box)</i><b title='Why'>How come</b> the writing is in Spanish?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't read my condoms!<br>
[Cut to the girls' apartment, Monica is putting things into her <b title='handbag'>purse</b> as Phoebe and Rachel watch.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Passport, <b title='↗tick'>check</b>! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_cheque">Wiki</a>]'>Traveller's cheques</b>, check!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who are you saying "check" too?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Myself. You know for remembering you've packed a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a, check! (Pause) My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, my mom used to put her head in the <b title='↗stove, cooker'>oven</b>. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But, it was pretty weird.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! Are you ready yet?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yep! You got the tickets?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh! Got <b title='them'>'em</b> right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!<br>
[Cut to the guys' apartment.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's <b title='completed'>all</b> London, baby! <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>Here we go</b>.

<i>Chandler</i>You got your passport?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, in my third drawer on my <b title='a piece of furniture with drawers for storing clothes, sometimes with a mirror on top ↗chest of drawers, wardrobe'>dresser</b>. You don't want to lose that.<br>
(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesn't know why, it takes him a little bit to <b title='figure out - think about a problem or situation until you find the answer or understand what has happened'>figure it out</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There it is.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where everything is.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side, ok? Ah, the garbage bags are next to the <b title='↗freezer, fridge'>refrigerator</b>...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, ok, but um, Rachel's <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be here too, can't I just ask her the <b title='things'>stuff</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, ok, give that a try!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Entering, with Joey) All right! Let's do it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Woo-hoo!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, <b title='goodbye'>cheerio</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>London baby!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, <b title='because'>'cause</b> that's not gonna get annoying.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(louder) London baby!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, you know what? I was wrong.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohhh, I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> come over there and give you a <b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b> and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thanks. Have a great wedding!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! (<b title='trot - run fairly slowly, taking short regular steps ↗gallop, canter, strut'>Trots</b> over)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, and great! You <b title='used to suggest that sb should do sth'>might as well</b> bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's book as Rachel comes in from her room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Rachel) So, we're <b title='↗take off, see off'>off</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Have fun!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, so, come! Why don't you come?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, well, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> work, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why-why can't you <b title='take off - have a holiday from work on a particular day, or for a particular length of time ↗get off'>take a couple of days off</b>?
<i>Rachel</i>Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is my wedding.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, you know what? Now we really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Entering, with Phoebe's book.) <b title='Here you are'>Here you go</b> Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Laughs) Thank you.<br>
(Chandler <b title="↗on sb's knees">kneels down</b> with his arms spread waiting for his hug.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You, heh-heh (She pats him on his head.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Bye, Pheebs!<br>
(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says "bye." In the hall, Joey says...)<br>
<i>Joey</i>London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!<br>
(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show moves its entire production to an entirely different country to make a single episode.

<i>Joey</i>Hi Chandler, do something! Come on, do something.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am, I'm ignoring you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on-camera-guy. All right, first stop, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey">Wiki</a>]'>Westminster Abbey</b>.

<i>Chandler</i>Ok, if you see a <b title='↗miniature'>little version</b> of me in there? Kill it!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="I've got an/the idea">I got it</b>! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>Here we go</b>.<br>

[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella">Wiki</a>]'>salmonella</b>. (Ross pushes her.) But of course uh, with salmon he'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!<br>
{When I travel by plane, I always bring a bomb, because the probability of two people carrying a bomb is much lower than one person carrying a bomb. And I know I won't explode my bomb, so I'm safer. Likewise, the probability of having salmon and salmonella at the same time is lower than having salmonella; it's not likely to have chicken and chickenella (Monica made the word up) at the same time.}<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. Yes. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I still can't believe they're <b title='tear down - destroy a building ↗demolish, devastate, bombard, earthquake'>tearing it down</b>. It really is the most lovely building you'll <b title='at any time'>ever</b> see. I mean it's over... (She stops suddenly, when she sees that <b title='demolish - completely destroy a building'>demolition</b> has already started.) Oh, my God!<br>

<i>Emily</i>(Running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we gonna do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.<br>
<i>Emily</i>How's it gonna be all right?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-huh, I see that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Entering) Ok, I talked to the guy with the <b title='a tool used for digging or moving sth such as snow or dirt ↗spade'>shovel</b> and I found out what happened.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>They tore it down a few days early.

Afterwards, Joey tries to film Chandler with his video camera, and Chandler <b title='↗clearly, decidedly, apparently, evidently'>obviously</b> <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hates</b> this. Then, Joey falls asleep, and Chandler tries to take the video camera away from him. However, Joey is holding onto it (in his sleep) and won't <b title='let go - stop holding'>let it go</b>.

<i>Joey</i>All right! Westminster Abbey! <b title='without any doubt'>Hands down</b>, best abbey I've ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Ok. What do you <b title='↗find'>think of</b> the abbey, Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think it's great. It's great. You know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really? To what?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>To Put the Camera Away!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Man, you are Westminster <b title='easily annoyed by unimportant things ↗bad-tempered, irritable, grouchy, grumpy, cranky, edgy, uptight, tense'>Crabby</b>. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.<br>
(The dressmaker puts a pin in the dress, but accidentally <b title='if sth pricks a part of your body, or if it pricks, you feel small sharp pains ↗sting'>pricks</b> Monica with it.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oowww!!<br>
<i>Dressmaker</i>Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!<br>
<i>Emily</i>We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I-I've ordered chicken, and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a <b title='extremely impressive'>spectacular</b> amount of food!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're gonna find a place. But even if- <b title='used for emphasizing that you hope sth will not happen'>God forbid</b>- you didn't.. So you <b title='decide that sth will not be done at the time when it was planned for, but at a later time =put back ↗delay'>postpone</b> the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have, you've tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!<br>
<i>Emily</i>I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.<br>
(Emily smiles a bit and looks <b title='↗embarrassed, awkward'>uncomfortable</b>.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, no. Oh, nothing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on! I am here to <b title='↗look after'>take care of</b> you! What do you need? Anything.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, that is all you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, so what do you want for lunch?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I do. What's the matter?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm just <b title='depressed, unhappy ↗dejected'>bummed</b> the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't 've lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Interrupting) Still in love with?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm not in love with Ross!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. No. No. Good! Ok, me neither.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, you know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, you know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! You know I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross you know. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. You know? I mean I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh- why didn't you tell me?!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We thought you knew!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, we all know! We talk about it <b title='continuously'>all the time</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You all know? Does Ross know?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, 'cause we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like you know telling Monica, "Hey, you know, you like things clean." Or, you know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."<br>
(Rachel stares at her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!

<i>Chandler</i>Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I embarrass you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?<br>
<i>The Vendor</i>He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing them?<br>
<i>The Vendor</i>(Looks around) They're all tourists.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, you know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) You'd make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.<br>
<i>The Vendor</i>Good choice.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, look. All right, <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>, ok, I'm <b title='out of'>outta</b> here. I am not gonna be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)<br>

<i>Emily</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.<br>
<i>Emily</i>We don't have to.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?<br>
<i>Emily</i>No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being <b title='destroy a building or part of a building =demolish ↗demolition'>knocked down</b>, and she suggested that we just <b title='put off - delay ↗put back, postpone'>put the wedding off</b> for <b title='a short period of time'>a bit</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She said what?<br>
<i>Emily</i>She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we can find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."<br>
<i>Ross</i>Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Huh? Do you think my sister's <b title='tiny ↗teeny-weeny'>teeny-tiny</b> little brain <b title='comprehend - understand ↗Reading Comprehension'>comprehends</b> that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn't right.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I-I realise that people are gonna be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it <b title='correctly'>right</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)<br>
<i>Emily</i>Don't you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no choice! Any-anywhere that's half-<b title='good enough ↗shabby'>decent</b> would've be <b title='↗reserve'>booked</b> months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.<br>
<i>Ross</i>The only thing I understand is: postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.<br>
<i>Emily</i>So what are you saying? It's now or never?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No. I'm saying it's now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>Or?<br>
<i>Ross</i>There's no 'or' in mine. What is wrong with these pants?!!<br>
<i>Emily</i>It's not the pants. It's you that is <b title='unwilling to act; reluctant'>backwards</b>. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! (She storms out.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on <b title='immediately'>right now</b>.) What, Emily, No, wait! Stop! Emily, please- (He catches something important in the zipper and <b title='howl - make a long loud cry ↗bark, haul'>howls</b> like a little boy and falls to the floor.)

<i>Phoebe</i>And um, a small piece of chocolate.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And a glass of <b title='not very warm =lukewarm'>tepid</b> water. (She gathers up all of these things.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Uh, only if you have the <b title='When you have hiccups, you make repeated sharp sounds in your throat, often because you have been eating or drinking too quickly.

<i>Phoebe</i>No! No, we have an emergency. Ok? Rachel's coming to London.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='↗flustered, puzzled, bemused, perplexed, bewildered'>Confused</b>) But, he loves Emily.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I KNOW THAT! You have to stop her! She's gonna ruin the wedding!<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title='wait'>Hold on</b>. Hold on. (Picking up a notepad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do... something.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so then I'm done my part, ok. It's your responsibility now. The burden is off me, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So tell me about this girl.
<s>The plane. Rachel's telling her story to the passenger on her left. The one on her left is still wearing his headphones.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>...And so then I realised. All this stuff that I had been doing. <b title='propose - ask sb to marry you ↗engagement'>proposing</b> to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Par-<b title="↗excuse me, sorry, I'm sorry, what">pardon me</b>?<br>
<i>Passenger</i>Well you say you love this man, and you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a.. this is a.. terrible, terrible plan.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But he has to know how I feel!<br>
<i>Passenger</i>But why? He loves this.. this Emily person. No good can <b title='happen as a result of'>come of</b> this.<br>

<i>Passenger</i>Oh-no. (He bites his fist at her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a <b title='while still affected by disappointment, depression etc ↗backfire'>rebound</b> thing from me... You'll see!<br>
<i>Passenger</i>Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were, on a break. (Rachel <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b> and doesn't know what to say. He puts his headphones back on.)

<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, we-we gotta find her. Phoebe just called! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No!! Ok!

<i>Monica</i>(Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.)<br>
(Ross and Chandler are standing next to the alter. Ross is practising for the wedding.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Using a slightly different <b title='the way the sound of your voice goes up and down when you are speaking ↗accent, stress'>inflection</b> for each.) I do. I do. I do.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, you're right. It's the second one.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Very nervous) Right?

<i>Ross</i>Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>What-what's going on?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nothing, nothing. Everything is under control.<br>

<i>Mr. Waltham</i>Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (Them all walk away. As he leaves he <b title='mutter - speak in a low voice'>mutters</b> to Jack.) I could kill you with my thumb, you know.<br>
<i>Emily</i>What was all that about?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding dress.) My God. You...you look beautiful.<br>

<i>Ross</i>You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're gonna have. (He hugs her.)<br>
(The front entrance. Joey and the bridesmaid are up against the wall kissing. Rachel comes in the door and walks by Joey unnoticed. She walks into the chapel and sees Ross and Emily kissing. She looks as though she wants to cry. Emily walks away and Ross turns and sees Rachel standing there.)<br>

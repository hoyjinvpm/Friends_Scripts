<i>Joey</i>Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, <b title='why'>how come</b> we never have jam at our place?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(Reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute, look.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, look, look.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What, what, what?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do I look fat?<br>
<i>Ross and Rachel</i>Noo.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, <b title='walk through - show sb how to do sth'>walk us through it</b>, honey, walk us through it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's like a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does <b title='↗girth (the distance around the outside of an object), length, penis'>size</b> matter?<br>

Or option 2, you can meet her at <b title='an area in an airport where arriving passengers can collect the luggage that has been carried in the hold of the aircraft ↗check in'>baggage claim</b>. What do you do?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's easy, baggage claim.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to <b title='hold sb/sth very close to you with your arms around them ↗huddle, hug, embrace'>cuddle</b>, at night, which, you know I<b title='be all for (doing) sth - support sth very much ↗be into sth'>'m all for</b>.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're <b title='-y - fond of or interested in sth'>cuddly</b> sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Ok, I'm late for work.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Well, I thought you guys were (Mocking Rachel) cuddly sleepers.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Noo! No, not cuddly, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the <b title='space'>room</b>. Ok, come here. (They sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and <b title='↗lap, shin, calf'>thigh</b>.) Ok, you're in bed...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. (They both notice where his hands are)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm gonna use the cushion.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to <b title='gradually fall asleep ↗nod off, nap'>drift off</b>, and then you hug her (Demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her over to her side of the bed. <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> you rollll a-way.

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it, don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but just 'cause he thought I was Ursula, <b title='used to express disgust ↗yuck'>ick</b>.

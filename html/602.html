<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, so, uh, did everything go ok with the annulment?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all <b title='take care of - deal with'>taken care of</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, thank you. Hey, you guys <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go see a movie?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah, why not?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, umm, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> get my sweater. (Walks away.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You wanna, you wanna hear something weird?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Always.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I didn't get the annulment.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh? Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross, can I just talk to you for just a second?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.<br>
(A cab <b title='when a car or driver pulls up, the driver stops the car, often for a short time ↗pull away/over/out'>pulls up</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, there's a cab! Taxi! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, the Angelica! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab's roof and it <b title='start to drive away from a place where you had stopped'>pulls away</b>.) (To Ross) You didn't get the annulment?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ross?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, (in a high voice) "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Yes, in that high voice! Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! You know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So ok what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?! Oh, woman! Sorry!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, ok, so, I don't have it all <b title='work out - find the solution by thinking about it'>worked out</b> quite yet. Just don't, don't say anything to Rachel, please?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one that knows about this <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> make me feel special. Ok!<br>
(Rachel's cab backs up.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to the driver) Ok, stop-stop! Phoebe?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What was that?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sorry, <b title='a mistake that causes confusion about details or arrangements'>mix-up</b>. Hey, how was the movie?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I haven't seen it yet!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Noooooooo!<br>
(In case you're wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names. Now, on with the show...)

<i>Monica</i>Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No. When it comes to <b title='↗candy'>sweets</b>, he's surprisingly strict.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, have you <b title='figure out - think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figured out</b> a way to tell him you're moving out?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, I keep trying, you know what, I can <b title='succeed in saying sth, esp when this is very difficult'>get out</b>, "Joey, I have to..." but then I <b title='suddenly become very nervous so that you cannot do what you intended to do ↗chicken out'>lose my nerve</b> and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to <b title='if you get sth unpleasant over with, you do it or finish experiencing it quickly, since you cannot avoid it'>get it over with</b>! You know what, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Ok? <b title='used to say that sth (the decision in this case) is completely finished'>That's it</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, so that's how this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around <b title='↗continuously, constantly'>all the time</b>?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>All right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling better? (Chandler answers him with some <b title='deep and made at the back of your throat =throaty'>guttural</b> sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.) Yeah, I'm all right.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Um, Joey, we have something to tell you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God! You're pregnant!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, um, Monica and I decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow! (<b title='tear up - almost start crying ↗well up'>Tearing up</b>) Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door <b title='if you are on the verge of sth, you are going to do it very soon or it is likely to happen or begin very soon'>on the verge of</b> tears as Monica stops him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you ok?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go! I've got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like you'd believe that. This <b title='if sb/sth sucks, they are bad or unpleasant'>sucks</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I'm-I'm just gonna be <b title='exactly'>right</b> across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(turns around) Maybe that's now.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Monica) Ok! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel, that it's my responsibility to tell you the truth, about him! Ok? He's a terrible <b title="↗classmate, playmate, teammate">roommate</b>! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... he umm.. he uh always, he always umm.. Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)
<s>Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch reading a magazine as Ross enters.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Pheebs.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey. Oh, look, here's an article about people who marry people and don't tell them.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(enters) Hey Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, have you seen Rachel?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, why?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I have some pretty exciting news!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>) You're pregnant!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! Chandler and I are moving in together!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh! That's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.<br>
(Ross returns from getting some coffee.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Monica</i>Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...<b title='shack up - start living in the same house as sexual partners without being married - used to show disapproval'>shacking up</b>. Oh, that's great. That's great. Come here. (Kisses and hugs her.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Guys, I'm happy too.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting <b title='annul - state officially that sth such as a marriage, an agreement, or an election has no legal authority ↗annulment'>annulled</b>... (<b title='wink - close and open one eye quickly ↗blink'>Winks</b> at Ross.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Anyway, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her would you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad? (Exits.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, bye.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Can you just, can you just <b title='lay off (sb) - stop annoying sb or hurting them'>lay off</b>, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should just go live under somebody's stairs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on <b title='romantic meeting'>dates</b>...<br>
<i>Ross</i>(interrupting) No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_barrel#Beverage_maturing">aging barrel</a>] <img src="220px-Lightmatter_wine_barrels-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Lightmatter_wine_barrels.jpg/220px-Lightmatter_wine_barrels.jpg">'>dating barrel</b> now.

<i>Phoebe</i>Ross, you're being ridiculous! Ok? You are <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b> and smart and <b title='kind, gentle, and pleasing'>sweet</b> and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's not really fair. You know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. (at Ross's glare) You're young!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's true. I am young.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='snicker - laugh at sb/sth childishly and often unkindly ↗snigger, smirk'>snickers</b>) Well... Ross, nobody cares about this except you! You- This embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
(She grabs his arm and drags him over to a table where three beautiful women are sitting. Now, I'm going to <b title='do sth sb strongly believe in even though it is risky or extreme, and is likely to fail or be criticized by other people'>go out on a limb</b> and say that their names are Stephanie, Karin, and Meg. Ok, so I looked at <b title='a list of all the people involved in making a film or TV program'>the credits</b>. Of course, only Meg is named later on, so I'll have to guess who is Stephanie and who is Karin. But, we'll <b title='used to say that you will not think or worry about sth until it actually happens'>cross that bridge when we come to it</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?<br>
<i>Ross</i>And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Monica is <b title='pace - walk with regular steps around a small area, because you are worried, nervous, or impatient'>pacing</b> anxiously waiting for Rachel.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looking down) What <b title='give away - show an emotion or quality that you are trying to hide'>gave me away</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I just gotta tell her, I have to get it over with. I've told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, that's it, so everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are <b title='you'>ya</b> <b title='↗horrified, terrified, frightened'>scared</b>? Are ya?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.<br>
(They hug as Rachel enters.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh, the worst day! You know, you think you're finally making progress at work <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> your boss calls you Raquel.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence <b title='ensue - happen after sth else'>ensues</b>.) Seriously.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me <b title='↗an American film starring Sylvester Stallone. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky">Wiki</a>]'>Rocky</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) All yours <b title='used for talking to a close friend or sb you love'>babe</b>. (Walks away.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, come here, sweetie. Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Ok, listen, umm, Chandler and I, are going to live together, here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! That's so great! Um, I'm so happy for you guys!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, and that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time moving together!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes, we are. (Chandler is <b title='↗hysterically'>frantically</b> trying to get Monica to correct her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw, and Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning 'cause you know Raquel can't be late.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Rach...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, he is gonna work on that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh. Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh Wow... (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on our door...<br>

<i>Ross</i>See? once you know the stories, it's not <b title='used to say how big, how much etc'>that</b> bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the <b title='a holy table in a church or temple'>altar</b>, a little my fault.

<i>Karin</i>Actually, I'm not dating at all anymore. See, I <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figured out</b> that I was only dating guys that were like you know bad for me, so I decided that until I can <b title='If you have sth all worked out, you have thought about it carefully, and know exactly what you are going to do or exactly what you want'>work that out</b>...<br>

<i>Meg</i>Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but, I wouldn't date him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.<br>
<i>Meg</i>It's just that he's <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> still in love with this Rachel girl.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(leaning to him) She said, "He's obviously still in love with..." (He glares at her.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is <b title='very foolish, not sensible'>crazy</b>! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you <b title='help out - help'>help me out</b> here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to the <b title='group of people ↗gang, flock, herd, pack'>panel</b>) Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't wanna be divorced three times.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. (gasps) I must say, "Well done!" <b title='well done'>Bravo</b> Meg.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(getting up) Ok! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Ok, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office <b title='immediately / at the present time ↗by now, just now'>right now</b> and get this marriage annulled! Ok?! 'Cause-well she means nothing, to me! Noth- (leans down to Meg's ear) Nothing!<br>
<i>Meg</i>Ok now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little <b title='strange or unnatural and making you feel frightened ↗weirdo, psycho, freak'>creepy</b>.<br>
<i>Karin</i>I am so attracted to him right now.

<s>Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are still <b title='debate - consider an action or situation carefully before you decide what to do'>debating</b> about how to tell Rachel that Chandler's moving in and she's moving out.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, when are we gonna tell Rachel what actually is going to happen?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Soon! I-I just couldn't <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, Joey's my best friend.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm not your best friend?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (She grabs a <b title='↗can, jar'>tin</b> of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(slapping his hand) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey-hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>These aren't for you! Are you upset?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am now!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey <b title='roommate'>roomie</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, bye! (Exits.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gasps) Are you pregnant?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Um-hmm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together, we meant alone together.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh no sweetie, no! You know what, this is my fault, I wasn't clear! I-I-was- I'm really sorry. And, listen, you take as much time as you need to move out ok? There's absolutely no rush.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Don't you want a cookie?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sure. (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe- do you need a tissue?<br>
(Rachel <b title='mumble - speak unclearly and quietly ↗unintelligible, incoherent'>mumbles</b> uh-huh and spits the half-eaten cookie out onto the tissue.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh- Monica, where did you get these?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I made them!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, good God, they're so yummy! (She re-<b title='ingest - eat or drink ↗digest'>ingests</b> the previously <b title="expel - force sth out of a container or sb's body ↗exile, evict, banish, exhale">expelled</b> cookie matter from the tissue.)

<i>Joey</i>Ok, who-whose is this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh that's mine.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(picks up something) And what about this? Whose is this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's mine.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, whose dishwashing soap is this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That was here when we moved in.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looks thoroughly at the label) Oh, I guess it really is <b title='↗a thick liquid is more stiff or solid than normal and does not flow easily, evaporate'>concentrated</b>. God, it's gonna be weird like when I come home and you're not here. You know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to emphasize that sth has never happened'>Not once</b> did we do that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't you remember that night, it was late and I was feeling sick and you said I would feel better tomorrow?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, I remember that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know. I'm just...just gonna miss living with you. (starts to stare at the ceiling)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, me too <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>. (stares at the ceiling too)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looking up) What the hell is that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's disgusting.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So I, I told Rachel that it was just, gonna be the two of us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah? Well, how'd she <b title='accept'>take</b> it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly <b title='very annoyed or upset'>disgusted</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?! I mean when we told Joey, he <b title='If sb cry their eyes out, they cry very hard.'>cried his eyes out</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! I did not cry my eyes out! Come on! It's like the end of an <b title='↗age, eve'>era</b>! No more J-man and <b title='a girlish name'>Channie</b>'s!<br>

<i>Russell</i>You got married again.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Russell</i>So that's your second marriage in two years.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, second in two years. Third overall.<br>
<i>Russell</i>Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never have I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...<br>
<i>Russell</i>(interrupting) I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.<br>
<i>Russell</i>Oh, that's better then.<br>
<i>Ross</i>This was just a <b title='a drunken person is drunk. This word shows that you do not like people being drunk.'>drunken</b> mistake and I-I need to get it annulled.<br>
<i>Russell</i>I see. Have you considered <b title='a form of treatment for sb with mental illness or emotional problems that involves talking to them or asking them to do things ↗shrink, psychiatrist, psychologist'>therapy</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I think just the annulment for today.<br>
<i>Russell</i>There are a couple of forms to fill out.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Easy.<br>
<i>Russell</i>And we'll need to have witnesses who can <b title='make a formal statement of what is true, esp in a court of law ↗witness'>testify</b> that you were not of uh, <b title='sound - physically or mentally healthy; of sound mind =not mentally ill'>sound mind</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No problem.<br>
<i>Russell</i>And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> already told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.<br>
<i>Russell</i>Of course you did. Look, Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is painting her toe nails as Monica enters.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, no-no <b title='purpose / usefulness'>point</b> in <b title='drag sth out - make sth last for longer than is necessary ↗get over with'>dragging it out</b>. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(grabbing the star) What the hell is that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, how about the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='↗a song. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_to_Remember_Me_By">Wiki</a>]'>Something to remember me by</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. You know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are you ok? You're not blinking.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking about how much it's-it's an end of era.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, all right. But you know, I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years <b title='count - be considered'>counts</b> as an era.<br>
<i>Monica</i>An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What is the matter with you?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is the matter with you?! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're-we're not living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, all right, but don't <b title='become'>get</b> mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah, sweetie.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(starting to lose her <b title='the feeling of being calm, confident, and relaxed'>composure</b>) You know what, we're not gonna live together anymore?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>

<i>Ross</i>I couldn't.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I knew it! Because you love Rachel.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's not that. Ok? Annulments are more complicated than I...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Ok? Would I do that if-if I loved her?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I've never been more convinced of your love for her.<br>

[Cut to Monica and Rachel's as Ross walks through the door. Rachel is holding the chrome star and crying.]<br>

<i>Joey</i>Great!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But then we <b title='end a romantic relationship with'>ditch</b> those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting <b title='the legal right to take care of a child ↗guardianship'>custody</b> will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.<br>

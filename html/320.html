<i>Chandler</i>Wait a minute, wait. <b title="used for emphasis ↗I'm telling you">You're telling me</b> this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it's like to be you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b>-to kiss her and-and <b title='↗feel up, caress, stroke'>touch her</b>, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Hey!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia <b title='died ↗pass out'>passed away</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes!! Yes! Yeah-yeah-yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>We were all <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> <b title='shake up - give sb a very unpleasant shock'>shaken up</b> about it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait, am I missing something though? <b title='because'>'Cause</b> I always thought death was supposed to be sad, <b title='from one point of view'>in a way</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well, not a nice person.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, she was a cruel, <b title='getting annoyed easily ↗irritable, grumpy, moody, bad-tempered, edgy, crappy'>cranky</b>, old <b title='an unkind or unfriendly woman'>bitch</b>! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You get the dollhouse.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, just a barrel.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what, you can play with my dollhouse.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?! Really?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Any time you want. You know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. (They all look at him.) More of a bathtub-type of situation.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Now Monica, she did give you one chance. She told Monica she could play with the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Looks up) Yeah, well, look who's losing weight now, Aunt Sylvia.

<i>Phoebe</i>That's a dog, every house should have a dog.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Not one that can <b title='↗urinate, urinal, urethra, bladder, kidkey, poo'>pee</b> on the roof.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive">Wiki</a>]'>radioactive</b> waste.<br>

<i>Monica</i>I don't want a ghost.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, <b title='↗jee, geez, jeez, Jesus'>gee</b>. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's what you say at the end of a date.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="if you say sth to sb's face, you say it to them directly">To her face</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(with a big smile on his face) I'm so happy!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just you know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a <b title='a strong and unreasonable desire to do sth ↗urge'>compulsion</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, ok. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.<br>
<i>Joanna</i>Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well...<br>
<i>Joanna</i>The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. I...<br>
<i>Joanna</i>Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.

<i>Chandler</i>Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'<br>

[He closes the door and walks over to get something from the <b title='↗freezer, refrigerator'>fridge</b>. He starts to smell something and turns around to see Phoebe's dollhouse smoking. He runs over and takes off the roof to reveal that the dollhouse fire.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, <b title='↗fire extinguisher, light, put out'>fire</b>! There, there's a fire! Fire!!<br>
[He tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesn't work. He runs over to the sink to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. In desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesn't work. He then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. He kicks open the door and we hear Monica scream at the top of her lungs.]

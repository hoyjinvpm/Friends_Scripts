(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Gosh, two in a row! You gotta <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_kiss">French kiss</a>]'>use your tongues</b> now! (They kiss again.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yay! Emily!<br>
(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are the <b title='↗possibility, likelihood, chance'>odds</b>? What are the odds?<br>
(They both move to kiss again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Stopping them) Ok, that-that's enough! You know, let, let's, let's someone else play.<br>
<i>Joey</i>If you didn't wanna play, then why did you come to the party?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right. I'll go. I'll go. (Spins the bottle) Somebody <b title='having many sexual partners ↗promiscuous'>loose</b>. Somebody loose. (The bottle ends up pointing to him) Story of my life. (Spins it again and lands on Joshua.) Story of my father's life.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, my turn!!<br>
(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands on....wait for it....Joshua. (You thought I was going to say Ross, didn't you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!<br>
<i>All</i>Ohh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's ok! It's ok! It kicked once, it'll kick again!<br>
<i>All</i>Oh my God!<br>
(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from kissing Joshua.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, well, every-everybody just remember where they were sitting.<br>
(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down, Rachel pretends she's knocking a bug off his leg.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>A bug.<br>
[Cut to later. The Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. You know why I'm never gonna eat meat? 'Cause it's murder, it's cold-blooded <b title='↗massacre, butcher'>murder</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
(He takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, Phoebe attacks the other end and starts <b title='devour - eat sth quickly because you are very hungry ↗gulp, swig, down'>devouring</b> the sandwich.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Phoebe, what-what're you doing?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, look, You know how-you know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, totally!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right. Ok. Well this is the same kind of <b title='matter'>deal</b>. If you're gonna do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!<br>
[Cut to the living room Ross, Chandler, and Emily are all laughing.]<br>
<i>Emily</i>I'll be back in a minute. (Walks off.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>O-ok. (Laughing still) She...<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Interrupts and the laughter stops) What're you doing to me?! I mean, I'm trying to get Emily out of here and you keep talking to her being all interesting and making her laugh! <b title='starting from now'>From now on</b>, I don't want you to be funny anymore.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Huh, You know what? Rachel wants me to be funny, you don't want me to be funny. From now on, I'm gonna be funny sometimes, and not funny others! (Chandler walks off while Ross seems <b title='↗puzzled, bemused, perplexed, bewildered'>confused</b>.)<br>
[Cut to later, Phoebe is finishing off her steak.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>You feel better now?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, You know millions of cows. (in a sarcastic tone) Mommy cows, <b title='↗ox, bull, cattle'>daddy</b> cows, <b title='↗veal, calf'>baby cows</b>..(in a serious tone) No. No, I will never eat baby cows! No <b title='meat from a very young cow'>veal</b>!!! (Thinks about it) (in a calm voice) Ooh, but veal.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, what if I said, I could <b title='if you even things out, the differences between them become smaller'>even things out</b> for ya, meat<b title='speaking of or referring to'>-wise</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, suppose, until the baby's born I <b title='lay off - stop using or doing sth ↗cold turkey, addict'>laid off</b> it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?<br>
[Cut to Ross and Emily standing by the foosball table.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, we can still <b title='be able to go to sth that has been arranged for a particular date or time ↗make it'>make</b> dinner if we skipped the <b title='a small dish that you eat at the beginning of a meal ↗starter'>appetizers</b> and asked for our <b title='bill'>check</b> <b title='immediately ↗right now, by now'>right away</b>.<br>
(Rachel enters, she has changed once again. This time into her high school cheerleading uniform.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna <b title='perform'>put on</b> a <b title='a short humorous performance ↗gig, costume'>skit</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! Have you <b title='↗insane, crazy, go out of your mind'>lost your mind</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No-no-no-no-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't <b title='work out - happen or develop in a particular way'>working out</b> too well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let - (Pause), actually I <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> wanna see what happens.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Nice uh, costume.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American goodbye cheer. So ok! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Ok! <b title='give me'>Gimme</b> an 'E!'<br>
<i>All</i>E!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Gimme an 'M!'<br>
<i>All</i>M!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Gimme an 'I!'<br>
<i>All</i>I!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Gimme an 'L!'<br>
<i>All</i>L!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Gimme a 'Y!'<br>
<i>All</i>Y!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What do you get? (She throws her <b title='a ball of threads which used to decoration'>pom-poms</b> to Joey and Phoebe and performs a <b title='If you do a cartwheel, you do a fast, circular movement with your body. You fall sideways, put your hands on the ground, swing your legs over, and return to a standing position ↗pinwheel'>cartwheel</b>.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil - Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler's room.) Ok! So that's me as a cheerleader! <b title='ta da - the best'>Ta-dum</b>! (Gunther's the only one that claps.)<br>
(Joey and Monica rush over to her.)<br>
<i>Joey and Monica</i>You all right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! You know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) Ok, what do I do now? What do I do now?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think you're <b title='finished'>done</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Uhh, that was really uh great, but I-I gotta take off, actually.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, come on, let's go get your coat.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Ok.<br>
(They both go to Chandler's bedroom to get his coat.)<br>
[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Rachel is my girlfriend.<br>
[Cut to Chandler's bedroom.]<br>
<i>Joshua</i>So, this was uh, really fun.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) You know, this bra... Really, bothering me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Uh, you know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, lot of memories. If these walls could talk, You know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn't co-operating.)<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Need uh, need a little hand there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>You really don't seem like you do. That's...<br>
(She is still <b title='yank - suddenly pull sth quickly and with force'>yanking</b> on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve. Finally, she gives up.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down <b title='↗plunge, stomp, stamp'>heavily</b> on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Well, what was supposed to happen?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought, that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Uh, <b title="↗sorry, I'm sorry, pardon, what">excuse me</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Murmuring) Seduce you. (Joshua looks at her) Seduce you.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Huh.Oh, uh! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don't wear, suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed <b title='them'>'em</b>!<br>
<i>Joshua</i>No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why?!<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Because I-I like you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You like me?<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated- a lot of this isn't you know, based on tonight.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!<br>
<i>Joshua</i>But...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no-no-no but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, I like you and you like me.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>Ok uh, however...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, now see that's a <b title='having a lot of decoration or bright colors'>fancy</b> but.<br>
<i>Joshua</i>My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But....<br>
<i>Joshua</i>I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.
<s>The <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of the guys apartment.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, there you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's ok. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the stuff I had planned, so...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Helps a little.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Is there <b title='space'>room</b> on that step for a pathetic loser?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, have a seat.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's ok, I mean it was just a, two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, you know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You seem to really like her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week, thing, you know no <b title='It means sharing your life with that woman.

<i>Rachel</i>Ross, that girl just spent the <b title='whole, complete'>entire</b> evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You think?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you've got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you're right.<br>

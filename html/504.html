<i>Monica</i>(In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.<br>
(Rachel enters.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! I just <b title='want to'>wanna</b> (Sees Monica) Ahhh!!! My God! (She runs out in horror.) Oh my God! Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='pull on - quickly put on ↗pull off'>Pulling on</b> a <b title='↗bathrobe'>robe</b>) Ok, I'm sorry! Sorry, I-I-I was um, I was taking a <b title='short sleep'>nap</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh! Since when do you take naps in that position? Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm <b title='having a romantic or sexual relationship with'>seeing</b> a guy from work! Ha!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>Gasps</b>) That <b title='sexy'>cute</b> waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening <b title='an actor [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Liotta">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-RayLiottaTIFFSept2012-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/RayLiottaTIFFSept2012.jpg/220px-RayLiottaTIFFSept2012.jpg">'>Ray Liotta</b>?<br>

<i>Monica</i>(<b title='panic - suddenly feel so frightened that you cannot think clearly or behave sensibly ↗mimic, mimicking'>Panicking</b>) Ok, umm, ok, umm... (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why aren't you guys at the movie?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone, they threw us out!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!<br>
<i>Monica</i>My God! Did he get in touch with Emily?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you <b title='very easily offended or upset by unpleasant behavior ↗cranky, crabby, bad-tempered, moody, grumpy, cranky, irritable'>prissy</b>, old <b title='a stupid or silly person'>twit</b>!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(Entering, happily, with a bottle of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne">Wiki</a>]'>champagne</b>, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha- (Sees everyone) -enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got <b title='a fold in a piece of cloth/paper'>wrinkle</b> free <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax">Wiki</a>]'>fax</b> paper!
<s>Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross, and Monica are eating breakfast. Ross is on the phone.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Oh hi, is this <b title='Grandmother'>Nanny</b> Hopkins? I'm-I'm looking for Emily. (Listens) Waltham. (listens) Oh, I-I'm sorry. Is this 0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2-9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7? (Listens) Oh it's "4-3", not 4-2. Oh, we-well, which 4-2? <br>
<i>Joey</i>(Enters, wearing a <b title='tuxedo (a jacket worn by men for formal social events) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuxedo">Wiki</a>]'>tux</b>) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Vomit tux? Who vomited on- you know what, what're you <b title='occupied with, engaged in'>up to</b> Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I'm doing this <b title='a long TV program that provides entertainment with the purpose of raising money for charity [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon">Wiki</a>] ↗marathon'>telethon</b> thing on TV and my agent got me a job as <b title='together with'>co-</b>host!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh that's great!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ugh, PBS!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's wrong with PBS?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, what's right with them?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, <b title='because'>'cause</b> <b title='exactly/immediately'>right</b> after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, you know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to <b title="a long-running American children's television series [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street'>Wiki</a>]">Sesame Street</b>, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well you know a lot of those <b title='a group of puppet characters [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muppet">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Bert_and_Ernie-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Bert_and_Ernie.JPG/220px-Bert_and_Ernie.JPG">'>Muppets</b> <b title="so they can't write">don't have thumbs</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All I got was a <b title='bad ↗crappy'>lousy</b> <b title='a chain with a key ring attached, used for holding keys'>key chain</b>! And by that time I was living in a <b title='a container with straight sides, a flat base, and sometimes a lid, some boxes are big'>box</b>. I didn't have keys!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, you know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What-what are you talking about?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, well-yeah, it was a really nice thing <b title='used to emphasize a remark that you have just added'>and all</b>, but it made you feel really good right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. So?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, may I ask for one example?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, it's... You know there's- no you may not!<br>
(They are standing on either side of Chandler as they discuss the point. Chandler, <b title='in the meantime'>meanwhile</b>, is <b title='feeling very angry and upset ↗appalled'>disgusted</b> with the whole argument.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's because all people are selfish.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you calling me selfish?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Are you calling you people? (Chandler <b title="to show surprise or disapproval [<a href='http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/12053/what-does-roll-your-eyes-mean'>link</a>]">rolls his eyes</b>.) Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Ok? And you know the <b title="what's happening">deal</b> on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus">Wiki</a>]'>Santa Claus</b> right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna <b title='defeat'>beat</b> you, you <b title='sb who has a strong bad influence over other people'>evil genius</b>.<br>
(Ross's phone rings and he answers it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on phone) Hello.<br>
<i>Emily</i>(on phone from London) Hello, Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Emily? Em-! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily) Hi!<br>
<i>Emily</i>Ross, I'm only <b title='ring - make a telephone call'>ringing</b> to say stop <b title='harass - annoy or upset sb repeatedly ↗sexual harassment'>harassing</b> my relatives. Goodbye!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No wait! Look-! Ok, ok, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!<br>
<i>Emily</i>Really? About what?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look you're-you're my wife. We're-we're married. You know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to the <b title='group of people'>gang</b>, whispering) She's talking.<br>
<i>All</i>(<b title='not very loud or bright ↗gentle, calm, suppress, muffle, mute'>subdued</b>) Yay! (He <b title='motion - give sb directions or instructions by moving your hand or head =signal ↗gesture'>motions</b> for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who is still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in private.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That he doesn't exist.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)

<i>Rachel</i>So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she might 've mentioned him, yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So Mon, when are we gonna meet this uh, new secret waiter man?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh, he's really <b title='↗introvert, extrovert, introverted, extroverted'>shy</b>. I-I don't think he's <b title='approaching a certain point, able to do or deal with'>up to</b> meeting everyone yet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't care! I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!<br>
(Chandler is <b title="↗that's so sweet">quite pleased</b> with that statement.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you <b title='a lucky person'>lucky dog</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's great!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Ross</i>In London!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>She wants me to move to London.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What-what-what are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. I mean, I can't leave Ben.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you just can <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_conference">Wiki</a>]'>videoconference</b> with him. (Ross gives him a look.) I'm not ready to have a child.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to indicate that you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> if I talk to Carol and Susan I could convince them to move to London with Ben.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be <b title='very ↗less than - not at all'>more than</b> happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It could happen.
<s>Carol and Susan's Apartment. Ross is trying to convince Carol about his moving idea.</s>
<i>Carol</i>Ross, we are not moving to London. We already have lives here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, but-but it'd be great. They-they have great theater, great accents. Uhh (Tries to think of something else) Tea. The-they have a queen.<br>
<i>Carol</i>So?<br>
<i>Ross</i>She's-she's a woman.<br>
(Susan knocks on the door and enters with Ben.)<br>
<i>Susan</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ben</i>(Runs to Ross) Daddy!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! <b title='used to introduce a piece of information which is surprising'>Guess what</b>?! We're moving to London! (looks at Carol) Yay!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hey, <b title='excuse'>'scuse</b> me, would you mind switching with me? I'm just<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>Come on</b> man! You've been here all day!<br>
<i>PBS Volunteer</i>Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?<br>
<i>Stage Director</i>And we're on in 3, 2, (Points to Gary Collins.)<br>
<i>Gary Collins</i>Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of <b title='a Canadian entertainment company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_Du_Soleil">Wiki</a>]'>Cirque Du Soleil</b>, (As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer getting into a <b title='shove - push sb/sth in a rough or careless way'>shoving</b> match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what type of programming you'd like to... (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are cooking, Chandler is reading a magazine.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Uhh, quick broiling pan question-<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes, it really <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> cost that much. Maybe next time your duck can puke in something from <b title='an American-based home furnishing store chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery_Barn">Wiki</a>]'>Pottery Barn</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Ok, <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it <b title='↗completely, totally, wholly'>entirely</b> <b title='be up to sb - used to say that sb can decide about sth'>up to</b> the gods of fate.

<i>Monica</i>A <b title=' a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_eight_ball">Wiki</a>]'>Magic 8-Ball</b>?! Come on you can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, it's not a toy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced for the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Ok then. <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>Here we go</b>. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. <b title='used to show that you are very surprised or angry'>What the hell</b>! This is broken! It-it is broken!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't <b title='depend on'>count on</b> it. Seems like it worked to me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, one more time. (Shakes it.) Should I never see Rachel again?<br>
(Rachel enters with laundry.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey. Ooh, Magic 8 Ball! What did you ask? (Pause <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhh, (Tries to think of something) do-does...Rachel <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> <b title='choose'>pick</b> the movie that we're all going to see tonight?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(excited) Excellent. What's the answer? (Ross turns it and Rachel reads it.) Woo-hoo!

<s>The Telethon, Joey answers his ringing phone.</s>
<i>Joey</i>(in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(on phone) Hi Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.<br>
<i>Joey</i>$200? You sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also know that they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves, you know, so, by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right and you don't feel a little good about donating the money?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, it <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>. I was saving up to buy a hamster.<br>
<i>Joey</i>A hamster? What, those things are like 10 <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, not the one I <b title="have an eye to - have as sb's objective">had my eye on</b>.<br>
<i>Gary Collins</i>(on TV.) It looks like we have <b title='surpass - be even better or greater than sb/sth else ↗suppress'>surpassed</b> last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! Yeah, te pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers...(He walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>! And may I say one of our <b title='sharp - attractive and fashionable ↗dress up'>sharpest</b> dressed volunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? Hey, my pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel so- Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, later that day. Monica is coming out of the bathroom carrying her cleaning <b title='equipment ↗gadget, outfit'>gear</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(Entering) Look, maybe I <b title='be/get carried away - be so excited, angry, interested etc'>got carried away</b> <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>. But there's something you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> know. If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Keep talking.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh! Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>... When is Joey gonna be home?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her <b title='a thick white liquid produced by some plants, esp the rubber tree, and used in making rubber, paint, glue etc [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex">Wiki</a>]'>latex</b> gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But, I just cleaned the bathroom.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, why don't we <b title='get rid of ↗lose the robe'>lose</b> the gloves.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. (She takes them off.)<br>
(He carries her over to the door and opens it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, let's show <b title='them'>'em</b> how it's done.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
(He starts to carry her into the hallway but hits her head on the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ow!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know that wasn't part of it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know!<br>
(He carries her into the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>.)

<i>Rachel</i>(Entering) Hi! You ready? You know- you- we're gonna be late!<br>
<i>Ross</i>For what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>For Stella! Remember? She's getting her grove back in like 20 minutes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. Do you, do you mind if I take a <b title='a metaphoric way to request rescheduling an invitation or an agreement [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_idioms_derived_from_baseball#R">Wiki</a>]'>rain check</b>? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, sure, yes. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's not that easy, there's still a lot of uh relationship <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Just stuff. You know, uh, kinda what Emily wants.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff is that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the <b title='the most important part of a situation ↗baseline, deadline'>bottom line</b> is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) <b title='↗how are you?'>Good</b>. Look umm, yes I've been-been thinking about that thing you-you wanted me to do and uh, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing what's going on.)

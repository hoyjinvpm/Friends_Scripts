<i>Joey</i>Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.<br>
<i>All</i>Who?<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right. I'll give you one hint. <b title='an American actor, producer, screenwriter and director [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty">Wiki</a>]'>Warren Beatty</b>.<br>
<i>All</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind of a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss <b title='used to mention sb/sth without giving a name ↗some'>this</b> guy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because he was just so <b title='used for emphasis'>darn</b> <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, as part of the auditions. See, I'm <b title='being considered for election, job etc'>up for</b> this <b title='role/character'>part</b> of this guy, who the <b title='↗hero, villain'>main guy</b> kisses.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you-you just <b title='used for telling sb not to complain about sth'>suck it up</b> and you do it. (Rachel looks at him in disbelief) Or you just do it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> do it, I'm a <b title='↗rookie, amateur, veteran'>professional</b>. Besides, my first girlfriend was Lisa DiBatista. So..I<b title='be no stranger to sth - have had a lot of a particular kind of experience'>'m no stranger to</b> the <b title='↗beard, sideburns, goatee, [<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Your-Mustache-%28for-Girls%29">How to Remove Your Mustache (for Girls)</a>]'>mustache</b>. <br>
<i>Monica</i>Then what's the problem?<br>
<i>Joey</i>See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and he says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me, not a good kisser, that's like, like <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/MotherTeresa_094.jpg/220px-MotherTeresa_094.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa">Wiki</a>]'>Mother Theresa</b>, not a good mother.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. You know, what<b title='does'>'s</b> Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on, I need your help here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. I'll do it, I kissed him <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>, I can do it again.<br>
<i>Joey</i>See this, this is a friend.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have <b title='chewing gum - a type of sweet that you chew for a long time but do not swallow [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Chewing_gum-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Chewing_gum.jpg/220px-Chewing_gum.jpg">'>gum</b>. Ok. (they kiss <b title='↗pretty, fairly, quite'>rather</b> passionately) Good, very good, firm but <b title='gentle and careful in a way that shows love'>tender</b>. I'd recommend you to a friend.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, you know? maybe you just <b title='tense up means the same as tense. ↗hang up, help out, cool down, warm up'>tensed up</b> a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, that <b title='if sth makes sense, there seems to be a good reason or explanation for it ↗sensible, reasonable'>makes sense</b>. (looks at Ross)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to say that you are determined not to allow sth to happen'>Over my dead body</b>! (Joey looks at Chandler)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! (turns around, and <b title='in a quiet voice'>under his breath</b>, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.<br>
(Rachel enters in this <b title='extremely unpleasant or ugly ↗hilarious'>hideous</b> pink bride's maid dress, with a huge silver bow on her chest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, Monica and Richard both stare in shock)<br>

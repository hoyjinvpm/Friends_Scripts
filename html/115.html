<i>Ross</i>Oh Mon, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What a <b title="loser/penis">tool</b>!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh by the way, am I gonna get paid for the full 3 hours? (Monica looks at her with an unhappy face.) Just a question, talk about it later.

<i>Phoebe</i>You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, where the hell is he?<br>
(Chandler's office, he's on the phone, <b title="↗worried, upset, distressed, ignite">agitated</b>.)<br>

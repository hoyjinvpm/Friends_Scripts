<i>Woman</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Woman</i>How much do I <b title='verb[intransitive] be in debt'>owe</b> for the muffin and latte?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh that's <b title='provided free by the owner of the bar, restaurant etc'>on the house</b>, <b title='polite behavior, politeness'>courtesy</b> of Joey Tribbiani.<br>

<i>Joey</i>It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!<br>

(There's a knock on the door. The <b title='group of people'>gang</b> is <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak ↗dumbstruck, dumbfounded, deadpan'>stunned</b> and Phoebe counts to make sure that everyone is there. Out of curiosity Chandler goes and answers the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes?<br>
(A woman enters.)<br>
<i>Woman</i>Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, Jill!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Wow! What did he say?<br>
<i>Jill</i>He said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer. Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud of.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach? (Points to Jill.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yes, sorry. Ok, honey, so, what did you do that made dad cut you off?<br>
<i>Jill</i>Ok, I bought a boat.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You bought a boat?<br>
<i>Jill</i>Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used as an interjection'>Boy</b> did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)<br>
<i>Jill</i>I knew it was stupid and I know I shouldn't 've <b title='go - engage in, bid, enjoy'>gone</b> it, but she bought me all the CDs and she said I had a really <b title='very pretty or attractive'>cute</b> haircut.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And your daddy didn't understand?<br>
<i>Jill</i>I know, and usually I just cry and say I'm sorry and then he forgives me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yes, good criers, the <b title='Rachel/Jill/Amy Green'>Green</b> girls. (Rachel and Jill glare at him.) I mean-I mean the uh, you know, the-the Green sisters. (They are still glaring.) Man, no matter how you say it, it still sounds like you're talking about green people. I'm <b title='If sb has reached rock bottom, they are in such a bad state or are so completely depressed that their situation could not get any worse.'>at rock bottom</b>. <br>
<i>Rachel</i>Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you've needed to <b title='become'>get</b> on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I- first I was scared, but then look at me now! I'm the only daughter that dad is proud of!<br>
<i>Jill</i>I just can't believe him. I mean, how <b title='does'>'s</b> he expect me to buy stuff?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe, you just uh.. you know, you won't buy stuff for a while.<br>
<i>Jill</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then you will <b title='get your income or food from ↗live on, earn/make a living'>live off</b> the money that you earn.<br>
<i>Jill</i>Ok...I know this is what you did, but uh, that just doesn't sound like me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, but it can be. It can be you, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course, yeah!<br>
<i>Jill</i>Oh, that's so great! Ok, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, I like cars.

<i>Customer</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Ok, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?!<br>
<i>Gunther</i>For all the free food you gave away.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> they <b title='↗champion, runner-up'>came in third</b> in a <b title='model - wear clothes at a fashion show or in magazine photographs in order to show them to people'>modeling</b> contest?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry, I- (He grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)<br>
<i>Jill</i>(entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day. Some of these are so heavy. (<b title='set - carefully put sth down somewhere'>Sets</b> them down.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.<br>
<i>Jill</i>Oh <b title='used to say that you think sb has said sth silly'>please</b>, I <b title='↗recall, recollection, ring a bell'>memorized</b> those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool <b title='manage to deal with a difficult experience'>make-it</b>-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't think charging new clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own.<br>
<i>Jill</i>Oh, Mr. Scientist has to <b title='become'>get</b> all <b title='relating to small exact details or rules'>technical</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Seriously, I don't think Rachel's gonna think it's such a good idea.<br>

<i>Monica</i>We'll try to be more careful ok? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.<br>

<i>Cynthia</i>I can't believe you thought that, you were gonna video tape us having sex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to <b title='accuse sb of doing sth, esp by showing them the proof'>confront</b> Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi <b title='you'>ya</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, is what she just said umm- Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) God, look, you were actually gonna... (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What is going on here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And with Chandler in the next room. What're you, what're you <b title='mentally ill'>sick</b>?<br>
(Chandler silently <b title='plead - beg'>pleads</b> with Joey to cover for them.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget <b title='↗porn, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_video">Adult Video</a>]'>adult films</b>. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)<br>
[Time lapse. Joey is closing the door after Rachel leaves and is about to confront Chandler and Monica.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We're so sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-wait! There's gotta be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh- I don't know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, get ready to <b title="coming out (of the closet) is a figure of speech (an expression which uses words to mean sth different from their ordinary meaning ↗metaphor, literal) for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people's self-disclosure of their sexual orientation and gender identity.">come out of the non-gay closet</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, just wait, please. I promise we'll <b title='think of'>come up with</b> something. Just give us a little more time.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!

<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, of course, Donald.<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior <b title="used when describing a particular person's feelings or actions">on your part</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, <b title='used to say that you have heard that sth is true, although you are not completely sure about it ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b> people now call you, mental.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Proudly) Yeah.<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>We want you to speak to a <b title='a doctor trained in the treatment of mental illness ↗shrink, psychologist'>psychiatrist</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all just because of a sandwich.<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>(laughs) A-a sandwich?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of <b title='a sauce made from the juices of cooked meat mixed with flour ↗gravy boat'>gravy</b> soaked bread in the middle; I call it the <b title='↗moisturizer'>Moist Maker</b>. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the <b title='↗refrigerator, freezer'>fridge</b> over here...<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>(laughs) Oh, you know what?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You ate my sandwich?<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>It was a <b title='ordinary mistake ↗honest mistake'>simple mistake</b>. It could happen to anyone.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>No, I-<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you perhaps remember seeing a note on top of it?<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>There may have been a-a joke or a <b title='a humorous poem with five lines [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_%28poetry%29">Wiki</a>]'>limerick</b> of some kind.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the <b title='↗garbage can, dustbin, rubbish, crap'>trash</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='stand up very quickly'>jumping to his feet</b> in anger) What?<br>
<i>Dr. Leedbetter</i>Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!<br>
[Cut to an outside shot of the museum.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!<br>
[Cut to a shot of a park.]<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You didn't read this one either?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I was gonna, but I uh, accidentally read something else.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='an American fashion and lifestyle magazine'>Vogue</b>! Hey, so tell me about <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> <b title='a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre">Wiki</a>]'>Jane Eyre</b> woman.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! You should've read it yourself!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh come on Phoebe! Don't be such a <b title='sb in a book or film who is good'>goodie</b>-goodie!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine! Ok, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a <b title='a creature that is partly human and partly machine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">Wiki</a>] ↗android, robot'>cyborg</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, this book was <b title='about 9 500 000 000 000 km'>light years</b> ahead of its time.<br>
<i>The Teacher</i>(entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she actually had some very interesting <b title='insight - perception or understanding of the true nature of sth'>insights</b>.<br>
<i>The Teacher</i>Oh. Well <b title='start to do sth'>go ahead</b> Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uhm, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, I-uh, what <b title='if sth strikes you, you think of it, notice it, or realize that it is important, interesting, true etc'>struck</b> me most when reading Jane Eyre, was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.<br>
<i>The Teacher</i>If you're talking about <b title='the belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men'>feminism</b>, I think you're right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
<s>Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch as Monica joins him.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey. Ok, so, umm, since that video camera thing didn't <b title='prove effective or successful'>work out</b> uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a <b title='a camera that produces photographs immediately, or a photograph from it [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid">Wiki</a>]'>Polaroid</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly in a way that can be heard'>gasps</b>) You're naked in this picture!<br>

<i>Ross</i>(in a <b title='the condition of being unable to think or act normally because you are not completely conscious ↗sober'>stupor</b>) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, are you ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why?!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='because of'>On account of</b> my <b title='a strong feeling of uncontrollable anger'>rage</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Which if I may say, right now, is out of control.<br>
<i>Ross</i>He gave me a pill for it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>A pill?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me that I had to take a <b title='if you have leave of absence you have permission to be away from work for a certain period.'>leave of absence</b> because I yelled at my boss I started to get <b title='work sb up - make sb very angry, excited, or upset'>worked up</b> again, so he offered me a <b title='a drug that makes people calmer when they are very worried or nervous'>tranquilizer</b>. And I thought it was a good idea. So I took it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute, they're making you <b title='have a holiday from work for a particular length of time ↗get off'>take time off work</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And you're ok with that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, you know, I hate it when they make me see the <b title='psychiatrist'>shrink</b> at my office. You know, he's always like "Oh, maybe your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better." Who needs that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You do.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are returning from class.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering, angrily) Ugh, it's just so embarrassing! I can't believe you just let me go on and on and on like that!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to <b title='a 1987 American science fiction action film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Robocop_film-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Robocop_film.jpg/220px-Robocop_film.jpg">'>Robocop</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That was not funny!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I <b title='snap - become angry ↗enrage, freak out, flip out'>snapped</b>! Ok? You weren't taking the class seriously.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was gonna be something we could do together! You know, I thought it would be fun!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, yeah! Fun is good, but you know I also wanted to learn. You know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, you know, Pheebs, I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?

<i>Rachel</i>Joey has got a secret <b title='a small hole in a door or wall that you can see through'>peephole</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(sees the picture) Oh no! no! no! (Monica gasps as well.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! Then he eats chicken and then he looks at them!<br>
(Ross stares in shock at him as he angrily puts down the chicken and takes off his coat.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(covering his eyes) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)<br>

<i>Joey</i>No! No! I am not a sex addict!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you could also explain it with the truth!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, what is the truth?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, what's-what's up?<br>

<i>Joey</i>(thinking) I slept with Monica.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh no!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You slept with my sister?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, is this true?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes it's true.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ahh- oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night, in London. Right Monica? (Smacks her in the ass)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a <b title='sth you buy or keep to help you remember a holiday or special event'>souvenir</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>My God Monica!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! And if anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back <b title='in bed - used to talk about sexual activity'>in the sack</b> <b title='continuously since ↗as of, from now on'>ever since</b> London!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>And the video camera?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhh, Monica? (Smacks her again)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess I set up the video camera to try and <b title='try to tempt or persuade sb ↗seduce, tempt, lure, allure'>entice</b> Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But sadly I could not be enticed.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Monica, this has to stop now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know. I know. I know. I-I will, and I would appreciate it if we all could just, you know, just <b title='stop talking about'>drop</b> it immediately, and forever.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Good luck. (rubs her back)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!<br>

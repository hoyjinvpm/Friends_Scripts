<i>Joey</i>(happily) Ok!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that like- I can't date her!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah and you better watch the <b title='flirt - behave as if sexually attracted to sb'>flirting</b> too, because you know, in such <b title='from a very short distance away ↗crowded, packed'>close quarters</b>, it could be trouble.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well that's gonna be <b title='difficult'>tough</b> Mon. I mean, it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and-and not flirt.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hmm. No, actually this'll <b title='issue in a result'>work out</b> well. Because when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Look, Chandler, Monica i-i-is really weird about this kind of stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you. That probably won't hurt as much anymore.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, she's not, ok? You know, I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her <b title='immediately / at the present time ↗just now, by now, right away'>right now</b>. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Terrible. <b title='used for emphasis'>I'll tell you</b> If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just <b title='spoil completely'>wreck</b> stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, come on, it can't be that bad.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ugh, it's worse. The only thing that's <b title='get sb through - help sb deal with a difficult situation or stay alive until it is over'>getting me through</b> is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I might even try to get out of here early.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! No-no-no-no-no-no. Sounds like uh, they really need you down there.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you're just <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b> with Ross?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>OK, well here, we'll just, we'll move the coffee table, closer to the couch.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Look, we do not repel women, OK? That is completely untrue.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh you know, yes we do, <b title='used to address a friend'>my man</b>. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)">Great Famine (Ireland)</a>]'>Irish potato famine</b>?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh you know what, girls don't like it when-when I start talking about science.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's not <b title='↗unique, exclusive'>specific</b> to girls.<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is great, this is great, what else, what else?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, oh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well, I-I should've told you the truth.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah. I'm <b title='↗dejected, oppressed'>depressed</b> about that Irish potato famine.<br>
<i>Janine</i>No, I mean with me. Because you seem to be acting really weird around me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, All right, let- let's just <b title='succeed in saying sth, esp when this is very difficult'>get this out</b> in the open, ok? You're hot. I'm lovable. <b title='↗apparently, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Clearly</b> there's a <b title='a general feeling you get from a person or place'>vibe</b> going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Joey...<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-no, <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand. Ok? So, the question is, what'd we do?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, but I'm just not interested in you like that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Janine</i>No! I mean, you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just, you know, I just, don't feel that way about you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I <b title='↗put on, switch on'>turned it on</b>.<br>
<i>Janine</i>I don't think so.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doing?<br>
<i>Janine</i>I'm OK.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?!<br>
<i>Janine</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, dear God!
<s>The park, Rachel's running by herself and panting. After a little while she decides to run like Phoebe.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second <b title='because'>'cause</b> then you're gone!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so <b title='moving in a smooth, relaxed, attractive way ↗elegant, gracious'>graceful</b>. (Turns and bumps into a <b title='mount - get on a horse or bicycle'>mounted</b> policeman and falls) Huh! Hey! <b title='watch out'>Look out</b> for the horse! (Runs off.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Ross are there. Monica enters.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Is it ok for me to come in now?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why is everything different?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Bye! (Runs out)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I don't-I don't see anything different <b title='except for, besides'>other than</b> the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, the <b title='a small table, usu placed at either end of a couch or beside a chair'>end table</b> is wrong, Um the couch looks <b title='very strange and unusual ↗weird'>bizarre</b> and don't even <b title='make sb do sth'>get</b> me <b title='begin to complain or be annoying in some way'>started</b> on the <b title='↗freezer, fridge'>refrigerator</b> magnets.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok look, don't... don't be mad, ok? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice, for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So, I moved everything around <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> I forgot where it, where it went back. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's ok. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do you want me to be afraid of you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but, I would never expect you to worry about that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you're the best. You come here to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, <b title='wait'>hold on</b>, ok? <b title='do things in the proper order; do not skip things that you should do first.

<i>Ross</i>So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So, theoretically, you could download your thoughts and your memories into <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> computer...<br>
<i>Janine</i>...and live forever as a machine!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh so, Janine, you-you-you know what, you know what we're doing right now? You and I, we're-we're <b title='if things or people interface, they are connected to each other or they join each other in some way ↗interact'>interfacing</b>.<br>

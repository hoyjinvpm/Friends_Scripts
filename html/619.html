<i>Monica</i>Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks. I know you guys like to <b title='criticize me a lot / treat me badly or cause problems for me'>give me a hard time</b> <b title='and everything else'>and all</b>, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait a minute, she going for spring vacation or she going for spring break? (Does a little <b title='whoop - shout loudly and happily'>whooping</b> party noise.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's-what's the difference?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, spring vacation you're doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're <b title='do - have sex with'>doing</b> <b title='fraternity (a club at an American college or university that has only male members) ↗sorority'>frat</b> guys.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.<br>

<i>Ross</i>I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, she's taken my class!<br>
<i>Monica</i>And slept with the professor.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I wanna call her.<br>

<i>Sebastian</i>Can I get you a cup of coffee?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel, what the hell is this?!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah and I-I found you one too, who is not a weirdo.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know what <b title='however'>though</b> you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.<br>

<i>Sebastian</i>Uh, no, <b title="used to say 'no' or 'not' in a less strong way ↗no way, nah, nope, not so much">not really</b>. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No reason, it's just I know a single guy who does care about other people.<br>

<i>Sebastian</i><b title='excuse me ↗sorry, pardon, what'>'Scuse me</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What're you guys doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you funny? Tell us a joke!<br>
<i>Sebastian</i>Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. Well, so do a lot of people.<br>
<i>Sebastian</i>Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call sometime.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he just left because of you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. You know, Is that the kind of guy you wanna take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, ok- I gotta go!"<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very <b title="not noticing or caring about other people's feelings or needs and not worrying that things you say or do may upset them ↗thoughtful">insensitive</b> thing for us to do. And, you know what? Let us <b title='do sth to show that you are sorry about the problems you have caused sb'>make it up to</b> you, we have two really great guys for you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! What've you got to lose? You know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, so you will meet our guys?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, I'll meet <b title='them'>'em</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok now it doesn't matter which one you choose, you know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can <b title='↗ask out, flirt, hit on'>go out</b> with the guy that Phoebe <b title='deem - think, consider'>deemed</b> not good enough to go out with herself.<br>

(Rachel laughs and stops after Ross' glare.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry, this is very serious. It is. And you know what, Ross? Here, you like her, she likes you, everything's gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're right. I'm probably just overreacting. So if she is staying at this party hotel on the beach with a huge pool and free drinks with every meal.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, if she's got enough money for that, she can certainly pay for the fridge she broke.
<s>Elizabeth's apartment, she is packing for her trip as Ross watches.</s>
<i>Ross</i>I'm so glad you're going on this trip!<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy you know, <b title='get rid of your anger, excitement, or energy ↗get sth out of your system'>blow off some steam</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you <b title='be into sth - like and be interested in sth'>into</b> <b title='craft - a job or activity in which you make things with your hands'>crafts</b> <b title='used to make negatives and questions stronger'>at all</b>?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ross, are you ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, yeah, of cour-of course I'm ok. What? I'm just being uh <b title='giving help or encouragement'>supportive</b>. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and- (notices something) what-what is uh, what's this? (He holds up a rather <b title="very short and does not cover very much of a woman's body">skimpy</b> <b title='swimsuit'>bathing suit</b>.)<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>It's a bathing suit?<br>
<i>Ross</i>To wear in front of people?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Is that <b title='supporting things that you know'>supportive</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='Is this supportive (supporting the breasts)'>Is this</b>?!

<i>Chandler</i>Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I- Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='you did it right'>There you go</b>! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! Ok! We can take a <b title='sth that you say or do to suggest sth to sb, without telling them directly'>hint</b>! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy <b title='If you go somewhere with sb in tow, they are with you'>in tow</b>.) (To Phoebe) What're you doing here?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>This is Patrick. (Points to him.)<br>
<i>Patrick</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi. (To Phoebe) Ok, you're too late ok? Because she's already with our guy.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>This is Patrick.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, hi.<br>
<i>Patrick</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not <b title='treat or represent sb/sth good, beautiful etc in a way that is as good as they deserve'>do justice to</b> what's underneath it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh-ok, but Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm just sort of in the middle of something.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Ok! Yeah, that's ok. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You can't do that!<br>
<i>Eldad</i>Maybe I should go.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(stopping him) Sit down! We're winning!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, you know what? Maybe I should go!<br>
<i>All</i>(Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! You have a seat!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Yeah, <b title='I&#039;m ok / No thanks / I&#039;m fine, I don&#039;t need it. [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091027113011AAnRBrW">link</a>]'>I'm good</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.<br>
<i>Patrick</i>You know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right Patrick, bye-bye!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!<br>
(He starts to get up, but Rachel stops him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No-no-no! Don't dance for me please. Don't dance. (She gets up to yell at her 'friends.') What is the matter with you guys?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, ok, let's <b title='discuss a problem thoroughly in order to solve it'>talk it out</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?<br>
<i>Eldad</i>I'm a little embarrassed. (Chandler <b title='shush - used to tell sb to be quiet'>shushes</b> him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'll tell you who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Then why did she ask us to...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I am still talking!! And then you <b title='make sb/sth leave'>chase away</b> the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, <b title='used to tell sb that you hope that what you are going to say or do will not offend them'>no offense</b> to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and you know you really- (Feels Eldad's hair) Wow, you do have very soft hair. But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than <b title='experience, esp sth unpleasant'>go through</b> anymore of this! Goodbye! (Grabs her <b title='things'>stuff</b>, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special <b title='a liquid that you put onto your hair after washing it to make it softer ↗shampoo'>conditioner</b> on that hair?!<br>
<i>Eldad</i>Yes, <b title='a large oval fruit with a yellowish skin and sweet orange flesh [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Papaya-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Papaya.jpg/220px-Papaya.jpg">'>Papaya</b> <b title='a substance obtained from sth'>Extract</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>So, uh, have a great time down there.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I will.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It was pretty funny when I, when I <b title='past tense of "hide"'>hid</b> it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's <b title='revealing clothes allow parts of your body to be seen which are usually kept covered'>revealing</b> which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, um, sun exposure.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh, don't worry, I have plenty of sun block, it's <b title='Sun Protection Factor. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_protection_factor#Sun_Protection_Factor">Wiki</a>]'>SPF</b>-30.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's 4, and I swear to God <b title='usually'>more often than not</b> it's just milk.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Ross, it's gonna be ok. I'm not going down there to <b title='have sexual relationship with'>hook up with</b> a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and <b title='spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hang out</b> with my friends.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Cool.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh hey! Here they are!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Call me!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So what was it for anyway?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I wanna say a disease.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Huh. All right.<br>
(Rachel does so and it's one of those dance party shows they have during spring break and we see...)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!<br>

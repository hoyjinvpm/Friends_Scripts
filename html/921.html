<i>Monica</i>It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, she is this new professor in my department that I did not kiss.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why do you care so much?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='↗concerned'>worried</b>) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to <b title='making out (kissing with tongue contact) + touching breasts would qualify as "hooking up."'>hook up</b> with lots of women! (pause) Look, I just, All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Tonsils_diagram.jpg/250px-Tonsils_diagram.jpg"> the two small soft lumps in your throat at the back of your mouth [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsil">Wiki</a>]'>tonsils</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean-<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, it's no <b title='an important or exciting event or situation'>big deal</b>. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh, God. I forgot how <b title='sexy ↗cute, gorgeous'>hot</b> she was! I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> get some more coffee.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>All</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>(to Ross) Oh you know, I'll come with you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. (they both go)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Joey) So, a professor, uh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally <b title='acrimonious words or quarrels are bitter and angry'>acrimonious</b> (pause) That's not how she used it.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>(talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't <b title='usually ↗normally'>ordinarily</b> go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't <b title='think less of sb - disapprove of sb ↗contempt, condescend, patronize'>think less of me</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you-you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who-who like someone and-and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> those people.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually <b title='have a romantic relationship with ↗ask out, go out, come on to, flirt, hit on'>date</b>. I mean, they're all professors, and <b title='intellectual - sb who spends a lot of time studying and thinking about complicated ideas ↗academic'>intellectuals</b>, and <b title='paleontology - the study of fossils'>paleontologists</b> mostly, you know, very <b title='relating to or affecting the brain'>cerebral</b>...<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat <b title='meat from a calf (a young cow) ↗beef, mutton'>veal</b>, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you wanna go hunting?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I would like to have the option!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(coming back from the bathroom) <b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up</b>? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!<br>
<i>Monica</i>And she wants to go hunting, too!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's-it's about, it's about corporate <b title='a strong desire for more food, money, power, possessions etc than you need ↗greedy'>greed</b> destroying our hearts and leaving us... the-the hollow shells.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't care about any of that!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, do you care about friendship?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.<br>

<i>Monica</i>(entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. (they kiss) What'd you wanna do tonight?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, well uh, maybe we could... (he sweeps the <b title='things'>stuff</b> off the table and <b title='↗speechless, careless, aimless, fearless'>wordlessly</b> invites Monica to have sex on it)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, trying to <b title='turn sb on - make sb feel sexually excited ↗arouse'>turn me on</b> by making a mess?

<i>Chandler</i>We really need to take those tests? You know, I don't like the words they use in those places, you know? They're so <b title='relating to a hospital or clinic'>clinical</b>. This is a pee-pee, that's a hoo-hoo.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. Just think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few <b title='activities that are done as a normal part of a job or process'>routine</b> tests.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But I don't wanna <b title='have sex'>do it</b> in a cup!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is the big deal?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's weird! In a doctor's office?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a <b title='an American chain of fast-food restaurants [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell">Wiki</a>]'>Taco Bell</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that!

<i>Monica</i>Oh, ok, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> think it's a good idea!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the <b title='the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hershey_Company">Wiki</a>]'>Hershey's</b> factory!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ok, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Caravaggio_Judith_Beheading_Holofernes-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Caravaggio_Judith_Beheading_Holofernes.jpg/220px-Caravaggio_Judith_Beheading_Holofernes.jpg">'>Caravaggio</b> uses <b title='the use of light and shade in a picture ↗contrast'>chiaroscuro</b> here to highlight the <b title='mental or physical suffering caused by extreme pain or worry ↗agony, torment, torture'>anguish</b> of the central <b title='person'>figure</b>. Touch it, it's really <b title='covered with/full of bumps'>bumpy</b>! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='no'>Nah</b> ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No <b title='ad-lib - say things that you have not prepared or planned when you are performing or giving a speech ↗improvise'>ad-libbing</b> and dude, you-you can't touch the paintings.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on! you- (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! (Slaps his hand)
<s>The Fertility <b title='a building or part of a hospital where people go to receive a particular type of medical treatment or advice'>Clinic</b>, Chandler walks out one of the rooms.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room, and I just wanna thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow <b title='pornography - writings, pictures, videos etc, designed to make people feel sexually excited'>porn</b> at home so this is like a vacation for him. So, did you do it? Did you make your deposit?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! yeah. Hard part is over!<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh, that's not the hard part honey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, no, there is talking to you, but- Monica is gonna come out, we're gonna go soon.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Chandler, the hard part is what comes next. Aren't you a little worried about the results? I mean, oh, when Sid and I did this last time. My God, I <b title='if sb is a mess, they look dirty and untidy, or are in a bad emotional state'>was a mess</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I haven't even... thought about the results... I just... <b title='↗presume, suppose, guess, reckon'>assumed</b> that everything was gonna be ok.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Slightly <b title='↗panic, panicked, panicking'>panicky</b>) Yeah, but <b title='used for asking what would happen in a particular situation'>what if</b> it's not ok? I mean what if, what if there is a reason we can't have a baby?<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica <b title='used to say that you think sth is certain to happen ↗destiny, fate'>are meant to</b> have children. I am sure it's gonna be <b title='used for emphasis'>just</b> fine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling again) Yeah, yeah, ok, thanks. I mean I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...<br>
<i>Janice</i>What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>stares</b> at her <b title='intent - giving all your attention to sth'>intently</b>, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!"
<s>Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging Rachel.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi!" And that is the Swedish <b title="a nation's official song which is played or sung on public occasions ↗emblem, logo">National Anthem</b>! Thank you for asking! (looks <b title='↗agitated, irritated'>annoyed</b>)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a-a friend who is a <b title='↗masseur'>masseuse</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Ja! Ja!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks <b title='feeling extremely shocked and sad'>devastated</b>)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>A-ha, A-ha, and why do you think that is?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such <b title='callous - (of the skin) hardened. callus - hardened skin'>callusy</b> fingers from playing <b title='of bad quality or unpleasant'>crummy</b> guitar...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ha-ha-ha... or, maybe she has trouble loosening your <b title='a tight uncomfortable feeling caused by a strong emotion such as fear or anger ↗complex'>knots</b> because you're such a <b title='used to describe sb/sth that always needs a lot of help or attention'>high-maintenance</b> <b title='sb who does not like to spend money or give it to other people'>tight-ass</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(now lifts her head) Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know it's me?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>For like a half an hour! <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, you can lie about Sweden!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How-how can you come here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How could you not tell me you worked here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't have to tell you everything!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes you do, if you're gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Tips not included.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because I was ashamed ok? I <b title='sell out - change your beliefs or principles ↗betray'>sold out</b> for the cash! <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> they give me, give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a <b title='the common name in the USA for the tax-qualified, defined-contribution pension account defined in subsection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Taxation Code [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401K">Wiki</a>]'>401 Kur</b>. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate <b title='sb who is used by sb else to do sth unpleasant etc'>stooge</b> and <b title='punch - record the time that you start or finish work'>punching a clock</b> and Ugh! paying taxes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there <b title='at the present time/immediately'>right now</b> and <b title='↗lay off, fire'>quit</b>! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='used to show approval'>Good for you</b> Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='ok'>K</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
<s>Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot <b title='them'>'em</b> up game on his laptop.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Haha! <b title="I've got you">Got ya</b>! Die, die, die!<br>
(Charlie walks in.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='recover - return to'>recovers</b> his <b title='the state of feeling or seeming calm'>composure</b> and starts typing) Respectfully, professor R. Geller. (hits Enter, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, how was, how was the Met?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Oh, the museum was amazing!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? Joey really knows this art, huh?<br>
<i>Charlie</i><b title='↗not really, nah, nope'>Not so much</b>, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even <b title='make sense - be reasonable/sensible'>make any sense</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What'd you mean?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗puzzled, confused, bewildered'>perplexed</b> for a moment) Wait a minute...wait, when you guys walked into the Met, did-did you go to the right?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>No, no, we went to the left.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey, Joey! Well still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Yeah, yeah, it's fun. (hesitating)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Well... I'm, I'm just thinking that maybe Joey isn't the right guy for me to be with right now, you know, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? Um, I don't know, I think, I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you could always talk about that with someone else.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Yeah, I guess that's true.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> guy Joey is.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>He is very sweet. <b title='used to add more information ↗besides'>Plus</b> he's hot!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That-that was gonna be my next <b title='a set of reasons that show that sth is true or untrue, right or wrong etc'>argument</b>.<br>
(Joey walks in)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Charlie) You ready?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks Ross.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you <b title='hook sb up with sth - to help sb get sth that they need or want; hook up with sb - start having a sexual relationship with sb'>hooked me up</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Glad I could help man.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
<s>Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not ok that I'm <b title='arouse - make sb feel sexually excited =excite, turn on'>aroused</b> by this now.<br>
(phone rings)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello? Oh, hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) Uh, no, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Uh-huh, uh-huh, well, so, what's that mean? (pause) Ok. Uh, ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up) <br>
(Monica walks in)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey sweetie.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Doctor Connelly just called.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. With-with good news? (very quickly and <b title='If sb wrings their hands, they hold them together and twist and turn them, usu because they are very worried or upset about sth'>wringing</b> hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would've said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just called! " But, uh, so, what-what is it? Is it, uh, is there a problem, is there a problem with me, or with you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Actually it's both of us.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>It means that my guys won't get off their <b title='a type of recliner (a chair in which you can lean back at different angles) made in the U.S. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcalounger">Wiki</a>]'>Barcaloungers</b> and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good <b title='↗odds, probability, likelihood'>chance</b> this may never happen for us.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(weeping) My God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry too.<br>
(They hug) <br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, we're gonna, we're gonna <b title='figure out - be able to solve a problem'>figure this out</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(still weeping) I know.

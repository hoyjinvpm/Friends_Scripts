<i>Monica</i>Oh Rachel the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. <b title='used to refer to sth that sb has said when you are answering them'>There</b>! That wasn't about the wedding.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, Rach if-if you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Only way to fly.<br>
(Rachel laughs.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me <b title='cruise - drive a car slowly through a place with no particular purpose'>cruising</b> in the bad boy.<br>

(He goes to the bathroom and after he leaves Rachel <b title='go through - examine, esp to find sth'>goes through</b> his coat and grabs the keys along with a $20 bill. The woman from before watches her do this.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>An invitation? That's like almost asking him to come.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler! He's your father; he, he should be at the wedding.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was gonna send him an invitation. But then I took a look at the stamp...it was one of those <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe">Wiki</a>]'>Marilyn Monroe</b> stamps and I thought "My dad has that dress."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow. That must be a very different view when he stands over an <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/The_Seven_Year_Itch_%28Marilyn_Monroe%27s_skirt_blows_up%29.jpg/225px-The_Seven_Year_Itch_%28Marilyn_Monroe%27s_skirt_blows_up%29.jpg"> ↗manhole, ventilation, sewer'>air vent</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>We have to invite him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't even know the man. Ok? We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well what're you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I <b title='spend a lot of time in a particular place or with particular people'>hang out</b> with you guys, and he, <b title='star - perform in movie/play'>stars</b> in a <b title="drag queen - a man dressed in women's clothes ↗cross-dressing">drag</b> show in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas">Wiki</a>] <img src="350px-Downtownlasvegas-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Downtownlasvegas.JPG/350px-Downtownlasvegas.JPG"> <img src="270px-Nevada_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Nevada_in_United_States.svg/270px-Nevada_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Vegas</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, I think I wanna <b title='exchange ↗swap'>trade</b> circles.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Trust me, you don't want him there either. Ok? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the <b title='bridegroom'>groom</b> is wearing a back-less dress.<br>

<s>A Street, Rachel is throwing her coat into the Porsche and getting in.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!<br>
(Suddenly from <b title='↗out of the blue'>out of nowhere</b> Ross <b title='dive - move quickly ↗whip'>dives</b> onto the <b title='↗bumper, windshield, wiper blades, steering wheel'>hood</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>My God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What do you think you're doing?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>There is no way I am letting you drive this car!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Couldn't find the comb?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No. So why don't you just hand over the keys?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
(Transcriber's Note: She puts the key into the <b title="the electrical part of a vehicle's engine that makes it start working">ignition</b>, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It's a tradition left over from Porsche's racing history. The world's greatest <b title='the ability to continue doing sth difficult or painful over a long period of time'>endurance</b> race is <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans">Wiki</a>]'>the 24 Hours of Le Mans</b>. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s Le Mans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, <b title='↗fasten, seat belt'>buckle up</b>, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that <b title='a particular time or stage reached in a process'>point</b> had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat belts, put the car in <b title='the machinery in a vehicle that you use to go comfortably at different speeds ↗R(everse), N(eutral), F(orward)'>gear</b> and start it. The driver's left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat belts with his right hand. That's why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No ah-ah-ah! Do-do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Ok! Ok! I will give you twenty <b title='dollars'>bucks</b> if you get out of this car <b title='immediately/at the present time'>right now</b>! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn't find it.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, Ross, if you're so <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked out</b>, just get in the car!<br>
<i>Ross</i>With you?! Yeah <b title='sarcastic'>right</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. (She <b title='↗pull away/in/off/out/over/up'>starts off</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(grabbing the car) Ok! Ok! Ok! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What are you doing?! Get in the front!<br>
<i>Ross</i>In the death seat?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh...<br>
(They drive off.)

<i>Ross</i>Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Really?<br>

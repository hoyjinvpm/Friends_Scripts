<i>Rachel</i>I just never, had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where-where you have to have somebody <b title='exactly'>right</b> there, in the middle of a theme park.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a <b title='a row of people, cars etc that are waiting one behind the other =queue'>line</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Alright well, see, I mean Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a <b title='much smaller than normal'>miniature</b> golf <b title='an area of land or water used for a sports event'>course</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>Come on</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, he said we were <b title='hold up - delay'>holding up</b> the people behind us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean, do you think there are people that go through life never having that kind of...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Probably.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>But-but you know, <b title="I'll tell you sth - used to add emphasis">I'll tell you some</b>, passion is <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> <b title='overrate - have too good an opinion ↗overcharge, overreact'>overrated</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It is. <b title='finally'>Eventually</b>, it <b title='kind of'>kinda</b>... <b title='↗run out'>burns out</b>. But, hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and <b title='a feeling of confidence and safety'>security</b>, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, <b title='↗gay, straight, -ism (the state of having a quality)'>lesbianism</b>. So you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(sigh) OK.<br>
<i>Ross</i>But, um... I-I don't think that's going to be you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You don't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Mmm. See, I see.... uh, big passion in your future.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Mmmm.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I do.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)<br>
(Ross gets up, pleased with himself.)<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title='all the priests of a particular religion or country ↗childhood, widowhood'>Priesthood</b>! Look, Ross, <b title='used to add emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, she has no idea what you're thinking.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah? She just <b title='run - move sth on a surface'>ran</b> her fingers through my hair. Were you missing that <b title='interact - communicate ↗inter- (between, involving two), act, interface, interactive'>interaction</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-no-no-no-no. This is running fingers through your hair. (Demonstrates). Ok? Now this (lightly touches Ross' hair)...is a <b title="make sb's hair look untidy ↗messy">tousle</b>. Look, if you don't <b title='ask out - ask sb, esp sb of the opposite sex, to go to a movie, a restaurant etc with you ↗go out, date, move in, engagement, break up, dump, divorce, alimony'>ask her out</b> soon you're going to end up <b title='unable to escape from a bad or boring situation'>stuck</b> in the zone forever.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I will, I will. I'm just, See, I'm waiting for the, the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What? Now?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's <b title='mess sb up - hurt sb; make sb have emotional or mental problems'>messing you up</b>? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? Huh? You just <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go up to her and you gotta say, 'Look, Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)<br>

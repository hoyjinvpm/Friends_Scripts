<s>A Restaurant, Ross and Rachel are on their double date. Rachel is busy talking Ross up.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>So it seemed that my <b title='a dance for high school students, usu held at the end of the year'>prom</b> date had <b title='stand up - to not meet sb who you have arranged to meet ↗blow off'>stood me up</b>, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>What a nice story!<br>
<i>Paul</i>So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! I <b title='↗certainly, absolutely, totally, completely'>definitely</b> did not see that one <b title='backfire - have the opposite result from the one you intended'>backfiring</b>! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, <b title='do sth slowly or carefully without hurrying'>take your time</b>.<br>
(Rachel <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Paul) You know, just-<b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b> I was a <b title='a student in the first year of high school or university ↗sophomore, junior'>freshman</b> and she was a <b title='a student in their last year of high school or university'>senior</b>. So it wasn't as bad as-as...<br>
<i>Paul</i>Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of <b title='sth you say to criticize sb/sth ↗stab'>jabs</b> and it's partly because I'm very protective, of Lizzie, and partly because, well, they just keep <b title='if a thought or idea comes to you, you realize or remember sth'>coming to</b> me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause) you're not (pause) <b title='completely'>all</b> bad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Not all bad.<br>
<i>Paul</i>And <b title='anyway'>anyhow</b>, I'm sorry I was so <b title='severe, cruel, or unkind ↗mean, tough'>harsh</b> before, but you have to understand I (pause) still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.<br>
<i>Paul</i><b title="↗(I'm) sorry, what, excuse me, pardon">I beg your pardon?</b><br>
<i>Ross</i>No! No! Not- I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.<br>
<i>Paul</i>You have a son?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I uh, share <b title='the right to take care of a child ↗guardianship'>custody</b> of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent <b title='conditions of agreement'>terms</b> as I'm sure you are with your wife! (Realizes) Oh, I'm sorry! (To Elizabeth) It's unbelievable!<br>
<i>Paul</i>Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married. (Rachel returns and hears that.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean that was just a big <b title='a drunken person is drunk. This word shows that you do not like people being drunk'>drunken</b> mistake.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're back.<br>
<i>Paul</i>You two were married?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!<br>
(Ross slams his head down on the table.)
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are entering and they're arguing.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee house at six.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We said seven!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We said six!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The only way that I said six, would be if I said the seventh, let's meet at seven, not at six.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah and if I had said seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a <b title='sb who thinks he or she is being witty or clever ↗smart pants'>wiseass</b> - seven!"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Turning around in the chair) Hi!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my good God.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ugh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know what time you said.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What time?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Quite an interesting <b title='an unexpected change in a situation'>turn of events</b>, <b title='all of a sudden'>suddenly</b> it's my book <b title='help sb who is having problems or difficulties'>to the rescue</b>, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly <b title='explain or solve sth, or make it easier to understand'>clears things up</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='very annoyed or upset'>disgusted</b>) What's it say?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thank you for writing your book. It's-it's a great book and you are the queen of everything.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thanks! So are you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He's wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(reading from her book) Monic... (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on <b title='↗go to a movie'>seeing a movie</b> Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's right.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Instead of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
<s>Joey's Dressing Room, Joey and Chandler are there.</s>
<i>Joey</i>I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.<br>
(There's a knock on the door and Joey answers it to Wayne.)<br>
<i>Wayne</i>Hey Joey, I wanna talk to you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah? Well, I don't wanna talk to you, Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi, how are ya?<br>
<i>Wayne</i>Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(incredulous) Why should I help you out?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(whispering in Joey's ear) The reason he just said.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(happily) What do you need?<br>
<i>Wayne</i>I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, you know, Sarah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Eh.<br>
<i>Wayne</i>I wish I could talk to her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What are you in love with her or something?<br>
<i>Wayne</i>Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, <b title='I know exactly what you are talking about from my own experience ↗tell me about it'>I've been there</b> my friend.<br>
<i>Wayne</i>Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if-if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach you know? It's <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> something you're born with if you- (<b title='from'>Off</b> Chandler's look) - You-you can teach it! I'll show you <b title='a phrase indicating approval, agreement, or just acknowledgement'>right on</b>.<br>
<i>Wayne</i>R-r-really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure. Yeah, I taught him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. You should see the woman I'm with, <b title='very'>way</b> <b title='too good/difficult/expensive etc for sb'>out of my league</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='chuckle - laugh quietly'>chuckles</b>) In fact, if you want, I can get you her. (Turns and nods 'no' to Chandler.)
<s>A Restaurant, Rachel is still trying to talk up Ross, not to much success.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean, if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.<br>
<i>Paul</i>How to make the next one even shorter?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Now wait a minute that's not fair. I mean he was married to me <b title='used for emphasis'>a hell of</b> a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. (Everyone looks at her, Ross's not happily.) Maybe I have to <b title='pass liquid waste from your body= urinate ↗bladder, kidney'>pee</b> again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>Well, this is fun. So, Ross, did you kill any of these wives?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! You know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you got a problem with me, frankly...<br>
<i>Paul</i>Are you yelling at me?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>God, no!<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>You know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.<br>
<i>Paul</i>Really?! (She nods <b title='If you reply to a question in the affirmative, you say "yes" or make a gesture that means "yes". '>in the affirmative</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!<br>
<i>Paul</i>Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesn't make me like you any better!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's ok, I'm not so <b title='liking sb very much'>crazy about</b> myself <b title='at the present time ↗just now, by now, right away'>right now</b> either.<br>
<i>Paul</i>Then we agree?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh yeah, I gue- Yeah, I guess so.<br>
<i>Paul</i>Neither of us like Ross!<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I like Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh! Kids!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh that's ok Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! I've got a lot of those too!

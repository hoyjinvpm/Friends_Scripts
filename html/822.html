<i>Ross</i>Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Are we <b title='going to'>gonna</b> take a <b title='limousine - a large luxurious car'>limo</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure! Why not?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars, today is my <b title='expected to give birth'>due</b> date.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait, you should come anyway. Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo. That way for the first few moments of her life she'll think we're really <b title='impressive'>fancy</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know, I just <b title='want to'>wanna</b> take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.

<i>Rachel</i>That's right, still no baby! (to two customers) <b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b> what's the matter?

<i>Ross</i>Uh, sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You. Like you haven't done enough.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I-I know how <b title='extremely unhappy or uncomfortable'>miserable</b> you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse">Wiki</a>] ↗seal, walrus, sea lion'>seahorse</b>.

(He sits back down.)<br>
(Rachel turns and looks at the group on the couch and they move over. Chandler measures the room they've made with his arm and decides it's not enough and they all move over again.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>God. (Sits down.) I have never, been so uncomfortable in my entire life!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that's a great story. Could you tell it to me when you're getting me some <b title='also "iced tea"'>ice tea</b>?

<i>Chandler</i>Hey! Did you have the baby yet?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? <b title='because'>'Cause</b> I'll do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you doing here so early?<br>

(Joey's cell phone rings and he answers it.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Estelle</i>Joey! It's Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.<br>
<i>Joey</i>One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!<br>
<i>Estelle</i>Well, I sold four of 'em on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">Wiki</a>]'>eBay</b>. You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God. So <b title='used to say that sth is completely finished or that a situation cannot be changed'>that's it</b>?! I only <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> bring one guest?<br>
<i>Estelle</i>Yeah, what time do you wanna <b title='pick up - go and meet sb/sth, and take them somewhere (usu in a car)'>pick me up</b>? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one <b title='↗spare'>extra</b> ticket to my premiere. So <b title='in some way, by some method'>somehow</b> I have to pick between you three and Ross.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='overhear - hear what other people are saying unintentionally ↗listen in, eavesdrop'>overhearing</b> that) What-what about me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You said you didn't wanna go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't. But I would still like to be <b title='acknowledge - show you notice somebody'>acknowledged</b>. What? Just because I'm pregnant I'm invisible?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Definitely not invisible.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you know, Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You know <b title='if you are not alert you will lose an opportunity. snooze - sleep for a short period of time =doze'>you snooze you lose</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>You really wanna take me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I could take everybody, but, you know, Chandler<b title='has'>'s</b> always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and <b title='head shot - a specific type of portrait. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot">Wiki</a>] shot - photo'>head shots</b> and <b title='things'>stuff</b> and well this'll be my way of paying you back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So you're never actually going to pay me back?<br>

<i>Joey</i>It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's-, it's everything. You know? He, he read <b title='words that an actor say in a play etc'>lines</b> with me. He-he went with me on <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc ↗cast'>auditions</b> when I was really nervous, and-<b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> he <b title='console - make someone feel better when they are feeling sad or disappointed ↗comfort, soothe, condolence'>consoled</b> me after I didn't get <b title='part - role, character'>parts</b> that I really wanted.

<i>Chandler</i>I always knew you were gonna <b title='succeed in a particular activity'>make it</b>. I'm so proud of you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thanks. That, that means a lot to me.<br>
(They look at each other and smile for a while.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(in a manly voice) I'm gonna go shave. (Gets up.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(in a manly voice) Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey <b title='give sb/sth a wide berth - avoid sb/sth. berth - a place at a port where a ship stays'>gives Rachel a wide berth</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I have to <b title='pass liquid waste from your body =urinate ↗poop'>pee</b>. If I don't come out in five minutes it's just because I've choked to death on the <b title='a combination of things'>potpourri</b> <b title='a very bad smell'>stink</b>. (Goes into the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's over a week <b title='after the expected, arranged or usual time'>late</b>! She's gonna have it today, right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hmm, <b title='want to'>care to</b> make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used tell sb that you accept a bet or an invitation to compete against them'>You're on</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, how much?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>One hundred thousand dollars!<br>
<i>Monica</i>How about fifty <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine! I'll call <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich">Wiki</a>]'>Zurich</b> and move some money <b title='to a specific place'>around</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(calling from the bathroom) All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!<br>
(They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No one's here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damn it!

<i>Chandler</i>It's just so glamorous.

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, and you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. You know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I have to go pee. <b title='according to the way a situation appears ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b> this baby thinks that my <b title='a part inside your body that is like a bag where urine collects before being passed from the body ↗kidney, pancreas'>bladder</b> is a squeeze toy.

<i>Monica</i>All right stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine! You're on!<br>

<i>Ross</i>You know what? Uh, the doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(silently) Ok. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know we should probably ask the doctor if she <b title='used for emphasis'>even</b> knows how to <b title='help woman give birth'>deliver</b> a baby that's half human half pure evil!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Hi Dr. Long, how are you?<br>

<i>Dr. Long</i>So, eight days late huh?<br>

<i>Dr. Long</i>Actually, they're things that you can do. Just some home <b title='remedy - a medicine to cure an illness or pain that is not very serious. medicine - drug/treatment'>remedies</b>, but in my experience I've found that some of them are very effective.<br>

<i>Joey</i>You fell asleep! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! I can't believe you fell asleep!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't believe it either. Maybe it didn't happen. Maybe you fell asleep and dreamt the whole thing! And this conversation we're having <b title='at the present time'>right now</b> is part of that dream! Wake up Joe! (<b title='↗smack, spank'>slaps</b> Joey)<br>

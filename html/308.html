<i>Joey</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>.)<br>
[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well maybe he's just taking a nap.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, we should call somebody.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And tell them what? That the naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, how are we gonna do that? There's no way.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Oh my God, is she going back to him?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. You know I woke up this morning and I was in love, you know I was happy.

<i>Joey</i>They have a kid together, you know?

<i>Rachel</i>(Confidently) I did!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know! You see, you have to watch them all the time.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Monica?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Umm, did you notice anything weird about-about Ben today?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I was just playing with him, and.. you know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's <b title='leave out - to not include'>leaving out</b> 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.<br>

<i>Janice</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, you know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I would always think you know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why they're not together.' and I-I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or you know, how happy he made my Dad.<br>

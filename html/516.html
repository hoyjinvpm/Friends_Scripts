<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But you know what? I guess I can <b title='blow off - treat sb/sth as unimportant, for example by not meeting sb or not going to an event'>blow that off</b>, (In a sexy voice) for you.<br>
(He starts staring at her <b title='in a way that shows that you want sb/sth very much ↗eagerly'>longingly</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thanks!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, say, Rach, let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, <b title='used as an interjection'>boy</b> they are really <b title='having close relationship ↗close, intimate, intimidate'>tight</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah that's not a bad situation they got going over there. Yeah, thinking of getting me one of those.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What's up Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>...is because they were friends first. You know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe. I saw you first. So...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughing) What're you saying?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm saying maybe you and I <b title='make sth move (by turning a crank)'>crank it up</b> a <b title='a level on a scale that measures sth / move up or down a notch - move up or down to the next level'>notch</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know, honey, umm, as uh, as <b title='feeling pleased that sb notices and admires you'>flattered</b> as I am, that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I-I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, you know, umm... No, honey, listen, I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is you know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then ask them out on a date. Don't <b title='talk to sb in a way that shows you are sexually attracted to them ↗flatter, ask out, go out, date, move in, dump, break up, get over'>hit on</b> your existing friends!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Won't-won't that take longer?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. I understand. I understand. Yeah. (Pause) <b title='used as an interjection'>Man</b>, I wish I saw Phoebe first!

<i>Ross</i>All right. Look, I-I drew a <b title='a simple, quickly-made drawing'>sketch</b> of how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Ok? Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Ok, I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.<br>
<i>Chandler and Rachel</i>You think?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.<br>

<i>Gary</i>I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> get some more coffee <b title='↗takeout, takeaway, for here'>to go</b> (To Phoebe) do you want anything, baby doll?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used when telling sb that you do not want any more when they offer you sth'>I'm fine</b>, thanks.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't <b title='achieve, succeed in doing sth difficult / wear in a way that seems natural'>pull off</b> baby doll, can I?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. I think we learned that from the <b title='a song [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Lips">Wiki</a>]'>Sugar Lips</b> <b title='an event, esp one that is unusual, important, or violent'>incident</b>. I'm gonna get some tea.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
(Monica leaves and Chandler moves to talk to Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How're you doing pumpkin?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='no ↗nah, no way, not really'>Nope</b>. (Chandler nods in agreement.)<br>
[Cut to Gary and Monica at the counter.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>So it looks like it's <b title='go - happen/develop'>going</b> really well for you two, huh?<br>
<i>Gary</i>I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(shocked) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Gary</i>What do you, what do you think?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?<br>
<i>Gary</i>Tonight, but don't say anything. Ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I swear, I promise. I promise. My God, I'm so <b title='↗bored, boring'>excited</b>! All right, but listen, let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Ok? Because you know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...<br>
<i>Gary</i>(To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Bye!<br>
(Gary exits and Monica rejoins them.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, what movie should we see?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! Really?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't <b title='hold in - to not express'>hold it in</b> any longer!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't believe this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='↗horrified, frightened, scared'>terrified</b>) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh! <b title="used to show approval for sb's success or good luck">Good for you</b> Pheebs, <b title='"good job", "nice work", or "good effort."'>way to go</b>! (Breathes a sigh of <b title='a feeling of happiness that sth unpleasant has not happened or has ended'>relief</b>)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, but it is fast. Isn't it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohhhh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, what're you gonna do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. I'll just handle it- I'll ask you to talk to him!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Me?! Why me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because you are so afraid of <b title='It means sharing your life with that woman. That includes loyalty, perseverance, honesty, respect and all of the rest. [<a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100308014821AArNFBj">link</a>]'>commitment</b>! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a... man!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, you know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That is so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll <b title='deal with'>take care of</b> it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are playing catch with a little <b title='rubber or plastic in a spongy form'>foam</b> <b title='a round ball that has a map of the world on it'>globe</b>.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Ross, is uh, is <b title='one of the five boroughs of New York City [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island">Wiki</a>]'>Staten Island</b> really an island?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohhh. I thought it was like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island">Wiki</a>]'>Long Island</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an island.<br>
(The game resumes.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, what time is it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looks at his watch) 2:17.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you serious?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. I realized it a half hour ago but I didn't want to say anything <b title='because'>'cause</b>, I didn't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='cause bad luck for sb/sth'>jinx</b> it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! We are <b title='fairly/rahter/quite/very'>pretty</b> good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, I think, my pants are a little loose!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey, you guys...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, is-is Monica here?<br>
<i>Joey and Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something I wanted since I was a little girl.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You bought <b title='an American television producer/creator, screenwriter, actor, and former singer. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Cassidy">Wiki</a>]'>Shawn Cassidy</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Noo! I wish! Ok, you ready?<br>
<i>Joey and Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.) <b title='Look at it'>Check it out</b>!<br>
(Joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly buy on the planet. Rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. <b title='Yes'>Yep</b>, a hairless cat! Joey and Ross start to get <b title='if you get sick or you are sick, food you have eaten comes out of your stomach through your mouth ↗throw up, vomit, nauseous, retch, gag'>sick</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>My God! What-what is it?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What-what the hell is that?!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's a, it's a cat!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That, is not a cat! (I have to agree with Joey on this one.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes it is!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why is it inside out?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Excuse me! But this is a <b title='a purebred animal comes from parents of the same breed ↗hybrid, crossbreed'>purebred</b>, show-quality <b title='a breed of cat known for its lack of a coat [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_cat">Wiki</a>]'>Sphinx cat</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>How much did you pay for that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it was a little <b title='using or spending too much ↗luxury, abundant, profuse'>extravagant</b>, but <b title='get a good deal - buy sth at a good price ↗bargain'>I got a pretty good deal</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? How much?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>A thousand <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>ON A CAT??!!!!<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's not a cat!<br>
<i>Ross</i>For a thousand dollars, you'd think at least it'd come with hair.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Or-or something.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right listen, ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my <b title='↗thigh, shin, calf'>lap</b> and just <b title='(of a cat) make a low continuous vibrating sound ↗woof, bark'>purr</b> all day long, and I would drag a <b title='shoelace'>shoestring</b> on the ground and he would chase it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Free cats do that too, you know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's not a cat!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh! Look, you guys, I'm really excited about this! Ok? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little <b title='a substance such as straw that a farm animal sleeps on'>litter</b> box for Mrs. <b title='whisker - the long stiff hairs that grow near the mouth of a cat etc. + "son" to form a surname like Johnson, Wilson, Anderson, Jackson, Thompson, Robinson, Nelson, Richardson, Peterson, Watson [<a href="http://names.mongabay.com/most_common_surnames.htm">link</a>]'>Whiskerson</b>. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? <b title='covered with very soft hair or feathers'>Fluffy</b>?!<br>
(Rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball <b title='moving first in one direction and then in the opposite one'>back and forth</b>? Eh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhh, the ball thing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could <b title='continue an activity'>go</b> like two <b title='on after another ↗in tow, consecutive, successive'>straight</b> hours without dropping it?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok!<br>
(They throw the ball back and forth once.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(catches the ball) Uh-oh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I have to <b title='get rid of urine from your body ↗urinate, ureter, urethar, bladder, kidney'>pee</b>. And Rachel's in the bathroom!<br>
[Cut to Chandler and Joey's, Ross is seen throwing the ball into the bathroom, <b title='used to say that you think sth is probably true ↗possibly, perhaps, maybe'>presumably</b> where Joey is currently using the <b title='rooms, equipment, or services that are provided for a particular purpose'>facilities</b>.]<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, I didn't think we were gonna <b title='succeed in a particular activity'>make it</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, ok?
<s>The 5th <b title='the police station that is in charge of a particular district ↗police station'>Precinct</b>, Gary's precinct, Chandler has come to talk to him about commitment. And as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of "<b title='↗hooker, prostitute'>Ladies of the night</b>" sitting there. (If you know what I mean.)</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Hey Chandler, what're you doing here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Gary, I'm here to report a crime.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It is a crime you and I don't spend more time together.<br>
<i>Gary</i>(laughs, then suddenly serious) <b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh well, I heard that you're thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Yo know, man to, well, me.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Sure. Ok. (<b title='↗signal, gesture'>Motions</b> for him to take a seat)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be you know, live-living together!<br>
<i>Gary</i>Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it'd make me happy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You mean scared.<br>
<i>Gary</i>No, I mean happy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Scared happy?<br>
<i>Gary</i>Chandler, what-what're you doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am trying to open your eyes, <b title='used by some men to greet a friend'>my man</b>! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe, she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!<br>
<i>Gary</i>I know! I can't wait!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Were your parents happy, or something?<br>
<i>Gary</i>Listen Chandler, the way I <b title='consider'>see</b> it is I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just- I wanna be around her as much as I can.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow, you know when-when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.<br>
<i>Gary</i>So you know what I'm talking about, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I think I do! You know what? You move in with her! You move in with her <b title='immediately / at the present time'>right now</b>! Maybe I should move in with Monica!<br>
<i>Gary</i>No, it's too soon for you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are still playing catch.</s>
<i>Ross</i>...now, when they found the <b title='dead body or the remaining parts of it ↗residue, remainder'>remains</b> of the <b title='The Mesozoic Era is an interval of geological time from about 252 to 66 million years ago.

<i>Joey</i>Maybe this should <b title='be more of A (than B) - be A (rather than B)'>be more of</b> a quiet game.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Hey guys!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter) It was <b title='exactly'>right</b> here, wh-where, where is it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!<br>
<i>Ross</i>How do you know? You don't have a watch.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.<br>
(He throws it back to Ross, but it's <b title='intercept - stop and catch sb/sth before they are able to reach a particular place'>intercepted</b> by Monica and the guys both scream in horror.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, we haven't dropped it in... (Looks to Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>2 hours, 27 minutes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?!<br>
[Time lapse, Monica has joined in and is calling to get out of work.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone, faking she's sick) I'm-I'm not gonna be able to <b title='be able to go to an event, meeting etc '>make it</b> to work today, Um I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)<br>
(Rachel enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Check it out! Almost 3 hours without dropping it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You have <b title="scratch - a small cut on sb's skin ↗scrape, graze">scratches</b> all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it's my cat.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(shocked) What?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, I got a cat.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't want a cat!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just <b title='flip out - become very anxious, upset or afraid =freak out'>flipped out</b> and <b title='beat/surprise/scare the hell out of sb - beat, surprise etc sb very much'>scratched the hell out of me</b>. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat <b title="hiss - make a sound like a long 's'">hisses</b> at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"<br>
<i>Ross</i>Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Rachel) What- You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I-huh-I was gonna let you play with it.

<s>Central Perk, Phoebe is drinking coffee as Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes I did, and I think you should do it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's a great guy, you know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You are useless! <b title='freak out - become very anxious, upset or afraid'>Freaking out</b> about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry. (pause) If he'd ask me, I'd move in with him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here, good for nothing.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Hey Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Gar!<br>
<i>Gary</i>(To Phoebe) Hey you sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! Ok. (They move to the couch.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>You look very pretty today.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thanks! Ok. (They sit down.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Here's the thing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Gary</i>You know I really want this relationship to move forward.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-hmm.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Because if you're not moving forward, you know you're just moving backwards.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Phoebe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Gary</i>I want you to move in with me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much that we don't know about each other.<br>
<i>Gary</i>(disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-ok, I <b title='understand'>get</b> it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just - I don't want us to jump into something you know, that we're not, ready for. You know.<br>
<i>Gary</i>(disappointed more) Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I really don't wanna <b title='spoil, ruin'>mess up</b> what we have. I'm just- I'm worried, it's gonna be a big mistake.<br>
<i>Gary</i>(<b title='at or close to the point where sth begins'>on the verge of</b> tears) Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Which is why my answer is yes!<br>
<i>Gary</i>(suddenly happy) Really?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so...happy. (She's not happy.)
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, and Monica are still playing catch, with Chandler <b title='look on - watch sth happening, without being involved in it or trying to stop it'>looking on</b>.

<i>Ross</i>(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Four hours? You guys 've been doing this four hours?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's right, baby.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>He's a <b title='sb who tends to drop things'>dropper</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah, that's right!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not a dropper!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's really a uh-uh three person game, you know?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's throwing and catching!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right. (He gently <b title='toss - throw ↗flip, fling, sling'>tosses</b> the ball to Chandler who catches it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to <b title='keep three or more objects moving through the air by throwing and catching them very quickly'>juggle</b> the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)<br>
(Rachel enters with the "cat" and the chick and the duck start to get <b title='rile - make sb angry ↗annoy, irritate'>riled</b> up.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't worry guys, it's not a cat!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my- Oh good God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(she's wearing an oven <b title='mitten (a type of glove that does not have separate parts for each finger)'>mitt</b> to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="seeing she's wearing an oven mitt">Baking it</b> didn't help, huh?<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I tried! They won't take her back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe that's because she's a <b title='an unimportant person who has to do what a more powerful person tells them to do'>minion</b> of the <b title='a Christian concept based on interpretation of passages in the New Testament [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist">Wiki</a>]'>Antichrist</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach, why won't they take it back?<br>

(Phoebe closes the door behind him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>So you're moving in with him. What happened?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I couldn't tell him no. He <b title='get - become'>got</b> so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> really like him a lot and probably do it <b title='in the end ↗finally, lastly'>eventually</b> anyway and <b title='used to add more information'>plus</b>, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.<br>

<i>Gary</i>Nothing at all?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, as soon as something <b title='if opportunities open up, they become available or possible'>opens up</b> we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.<br>
<i>Gary</i>So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the <b title='The New York Post is an American daily newspaper [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post">Wiki</a>]'>Post</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?<br>
<i>Gary</i>In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, yeah! Today's.<br>
<i>Gary</i>'Cause uh, huh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair) and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights!<br>

<i>Gary</i>Let me tell you what I think might be going on here. (Phoebe looks down in shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does so) Ok, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts 'cause things are moving too fast for someone. Does that sound <b title='used to make negatives and questions stronger'>at all</b> possible to you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes. Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Phoebe...<br>

<i>Gary</i>Phoebe, it's ok that you feel this way. I mean it is soon.

<i>Gary</i>Sweetheart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just- I want you to be happy<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Living with you would make me happy.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Phoebe, you don't have to say that.<br>

<i>All</i>Oh yea. Yeah!
<s>Central Perk, everyone is there.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Man, that was great huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball <b title='used for emphasis'>all</b> around?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, it is amazing it lasted that long.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know. My arm <b title='if part of your body is killing you, it is causing you a lot of pain ↗sore, ache, twist, wrench, strain, spasm, contraction, cramp'>is killing me</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, how did I get this <b title='↗infamous, notorious'>reputation</b> as a dropper? Ok? I'm <b title='used to emphasize that sb/sth does not have a particular quality'>anything but</b> a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a <b title='a light plastic disc that one person throws to another as a game ↗freebie'>Frisbee</b>, a <b title="/'rekəd/ a large round piece of plastic containing music or other sounds ↗vinyl">record</b>, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not gonna describe them, you'll have to see them.)<br>

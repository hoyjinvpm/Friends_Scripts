<i>Monica</i>(entering from her room) Oww!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, what's the matter honey?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! (<b title='show sth to a lot of people because you are very proud of it ↗strut'>Shows off</b> the ring.) How long before that starts getting annoying?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It starts.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, so let's actually get started on the wedding plans!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! (Runs off.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='unable or unwilling to believe sth ↗quizical'>incredulous</b>) Already?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the <b title='caterer - a person or business that organizes the food and drinks at an event such as a party or meeting'>caterers</b>, the music...<br>

<i>Chandler</i>What in God's name is that?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!<br>
<i>Monica</i>This baby has got everything. Take, you know, locations, for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by <b title='footage - length or distance measured in feet ↗area'>square footage</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(looking through the book) Oh <b title='used as an interjection'>my</b> look, here's the invitation you used to your wedding to John Linch in the 5th grade. Remember, I got sick and Ross had to <b title="do sb's job ↗take over">fill in</b> as a bridesmaid.<br>

(<b title='motion - give sb directions or instructions by moving your hand or head =signal ↗gesture'>Motions</b> that they should learn everyone's hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what's going on?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple of days?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Umm, ok, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Nothing. Why?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, you said it was urgent!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to the students) Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel and Monica are <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> telling Chandler what the wedding plans are.</s>

<i>Joey</i>(sitting up from the couch) Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) You know, something a little <b title='snuggle - settle into a warm comfortable position'>snugglyer</b>?<br>

<i>Joey</i>Uh, well he did not get <b title='↗vomit, throw up, retch, gag'>sick</b> somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Now, do I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think they're a little more <b title='-y - having a quality'>weddingy</b> you know. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! It's like one mind.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh-huh!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck quacks and Joey <b title='recoil - move back suddenly and quickly from sth you do not like or are afraid of'>recoils</b> in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (He's about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel's room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) That's so soft. (He pulls back the <b title='a cover for a bed that is filled with a soft warm material ↗duvet, quilt, bedclothes'>comforter</b>.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and <b title='groan - make a long deep sound =moan'>groans</b> in delight.

<i>Ross</i>And Joel, Don't touch any of my dinosaurs. I know they're cool but they're mine.<br>
(They go into the hall.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.<br>

<i>Mrs. Geller</i>We're sorry honey, but we just <b title='↗presume, take sth for granted'>assumed</b> if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I'm sorry?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him <b title='an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to acupuncture [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupressure">Wiki</a>]'>accupressure</b> with a pair of chopsticks.

<i>Joey</i><b title='I understand'>Gotcha</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look, Ross, I really need that $80 every week.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I'm sure you'll find another massage client Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah I'm sure I will too. But until then I'm going to massage you every week for the price of $100.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You just said 80.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't want to, I'm scared.<br>

<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Listen, umm, I've been thinking, and, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you work for that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I thought about it too, and, I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You do?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hmm, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Ohhh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and <b title='things'>stuff</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, you know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> go to college.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You thought about that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How many kids were we gonna have?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What else did you think about?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, stuff like where'd we live, you know? Like a, small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. You know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) You know what? I-I don't want, want a big, <b title='expensive and fashionable'>fancy</b> wedding.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure you do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You sure?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-hmm.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I love you so much.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talking about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, totally!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh good.

<i>Joey</i>(talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful... why are we fighting this? You know you want it to happen as much as I do.<br>

<i>Joey</i>I want you. I need you. Let me make love to you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='prevent sth from happening'>stand in the way of</b> true love or anything, but I think a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Cantaloupes.jpg/220px-Cantaloupes.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantaloupe">Wiki</a>]'>cantaloupe</b> might hurt less.<br>

They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Woow! I haven't seen you this <b title='work sb up - make sb very angry, excited, or upset about sth'>worked up</b> since you did that dog food <b title='ad on TV/radio'>commercial</b> and you thought you were <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be with a real talking dog!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, that was a disappointment... (pause) Oh, hey! You wanna uh, come down to the <b title='a place where a film or TV program is filmed ↗studio'>set</b> and tell me if I'm doing ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(excited) Are you serious?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah! Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, that was an <b title='sth not done deliberately ↗intentional, accidental, on purpose'>honest mistake</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right! (he starts to <b title='↗copy, do, emulate, impersonate, imitate, mimic, mock, mime, simulate'>ape</b> her) "Oh my God, is this the <b title="↗bathroom, restroom, women's room, ladies' room">men's room</b>?

<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'd love to!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well you can't! We're booked <b title='completely, continuously'>solid</b> for the next month!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I can't give you a massage, because my license's been <b title='revoke - officially say that sth is no longer legal'>revoked</b> again!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, what happened?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it was an accident... You know, it's, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just <b title='slip - slide'>slips</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, the restaurant is doing well, you said?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It is so great! There-there are people <b title='↗queue'>lining</b> up in the street to taste my food. Next Saturday, there's a waiting list of 50 people.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗tell me about it'>I know how that feels</b>. Last <b title='term'>semester</b> I had two students who-who wanted to take my 1:00 class, but-but it was full. So, so they had to take my 5:00. (Pauses) That's not the same.<br>
(Chandler enters)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you! Pack your bags!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So, what'd you say? Can you get out of work?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, honey! I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you really that busy?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I-I'm sorry. I really am.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, that's ok. I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it. (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not <b title='A refundable payment will be paid back to you in certain circumstances ↗reimburse'>refundable</b>? Oh can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Tell them I'm a <b title='a skilled cook'>chef</b> at a big New York restaurant!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And-and tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a <b title='↗massage, masseur'>masseuse</b> in good <b title="sb's rank or position in a system, organization, society etc, based on what other people think of them">standing</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(on the phone) Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok? (pause) Oh, thank you very much! (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your <b title='insurance that is intended to cover medical expenses, financial default of travel suppliers, and other losses incurred while traveling.

<i>Phoebe</i>I'll go!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I'll <b title='pick up - go to the place where sb is and take them away, often in a car'>pick you up</b> at ten.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, go with you? (Pauses) Oh. I can't go.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why don't you take Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Don't, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, not if their room has two beds!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(browsing the brochure) I guess... still seems a little... (<b title='↗excitedly'>enthusiastically</b>) moonlight boat ride!

<i>Rachel</i>Well, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-<b title='things'>stuff</b>"!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!<br>
<i>Director</i>Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, all right, wish me luck!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, <b title='used to say you are not suggesting sth'>not that</b> you need it but good... GOD! Is that Chase Lassiter? <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>Now</b> he's straight, right?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)<br>

(The scene starts. Joey enters and there's a girl wearing a wedding dress near a bed)<br>
<i>Actress/Olivia</i>Drake! What're you doing in here?<br>
<i>Joey/Drake</i>Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.<br>
<i>Actress/Olivia</i>Get out!<br>
<i>Joey/Drake</i>You don't love him!<br>

<i>Joey/Drake</i>Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...<br>
<i>Chase Lassiter</i>(talking to Rachel) You look real familiar, have we...<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='↗shush'>Shhh</b>! She's asking her a question! (Chase Lassiter leaves.)<br>
<i>Joey/Drake</i>Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could've been?<br>
<i>Actress/Olivia</i>I don't have a choice...<br>
<i>Joey/Drake</i>Yes, you do. Yes... you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I... because I can't stop loving you.<br>
<i>Actress/Olivia</i>Don't say that...<br>
<i>Joey/Drake</i>Tell me to stop, just... tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)<br>
<i>Director</i>CUT!<br>

<i>3rd Customer</i>The <b title='↗electrician, magician, mathematician, optician, physician, technician'>musician</b>, <b title='exactly'>right</b> outside the restaurant... it's kind of a mood-killer!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What musician?

<i>Monica</i>Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow, what'd you think <b title='bring on - cause to appear'>brought that on</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.<br>
<i>Monica</i>A love scene? With-with who?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Olivia.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh, right, real life more important.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, do you think that my dream means anything?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a <b title='↗crush'>thing</b> for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course it was! Trust me, <b title='when you are dealing with sth or talking about sth'>when it comes to</b> psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two <b title='psychology'>psych</b> classes in college.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! You took the same class twice.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It was hard!<br>
(Phoebe comes in)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at you restaurant (she <b title='don - put on a piece of clothing'>dons</b> a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of <b title='eyeglasses ↗monocle'>spectacles</b> to her eyes) Right? I think, this might even <b title='↗classy'>class up</b> the <b title='a song or poem that tells a story / a slow love song ↗ode'>ballad</b> of the <b title="circumcise - cut off the skin at the end of the penis / cut off a woman's clitoris">uncircumcised</b> man.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh... Phoebe? Maybe-maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is a sort of an <b title='relating to people from a high social class who have a lot of money'>upscale</b> place.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the <b title='the main male servant of a house ↗houseboy, housekeeper, maid'>butler</b> to <b title='go to another place to get sb/sth and bring them back'>fetch</b> my diamonds out of the <b title='a room with thick walls and a strong door where money etc is kept ↗safe'>vault</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, it's-it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot) .<br>
(silence)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, so, you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, we're still on that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I didn't say your songs weren't good enough.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well then what's wrong with them?

<i>Monica</i>Oh? Oh really, you wanna talk about quality? Have you heard of a <b title='a set of musical notes that are based on one particular note'>key</b>? It's what some people sing in.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Earplugs, or <b title='clove - a small section of the bulb of a garlic'>cloves</b> of garlic?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what? You know what? I take back what I said <b title='at an earlier time ↗then, once'>before</b>. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are gonna up like crazy.<br>

(raises her hand)<br>

<i>Joey</i>A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that-that I'm in love with Olivia.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So?<br>
<i>Joey</i>So... I-I've never played that!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh... well... just once... with you...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok... now this could be a little awkward... I'm just gonna <b title='leave, exit'>blow</b> past it... well look can't you just use that-that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's-there's this party scene coming up.. and-and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but, he can't... And that makes me think about, all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but, you didn't know so I would just, you know, pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(looks <b title='↗moving'>touched</b>) Joey, you never.. you never talked about that before...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake <b title='sneak - go secretly ↗sneaker, stealth'>sneaks</b> into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he-he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she... is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, because I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with <b title='feelings of pity, love, sadness etc'>sentiment</b>) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.<br>
(Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh no-no Joey, I am not gonna tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.<br>

<i>Joey</i>No, I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! They took mine to give to you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why would they take away our keys?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe they don't trust us.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.<br>

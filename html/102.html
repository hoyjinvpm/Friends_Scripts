<i>Monica</i>What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, right!... Serious?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Absolutely.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I think for us, kissing is <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> like an opening <b title='a short performance on stage or TV by sb who plays music or tells jokes'>act</b>, you know? I mean it's like the <b title='stand-up comedy involves one person telling jokes alone as a performance'>stand-up</b> <b title='sb whose job is to tell jokes and make people laugh ↗comedy, tragedy'>comedian</b> you have to <b title='stay until the end of sth, esp if you are not enjoying it'>sit through</b> before <b title='an English rock band [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd">Wiki</a>]'>Pink Floyd</b> comes out.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's just that that's... that's not why we bought the ticket.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You see, the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, you know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> find yourself sitting at home, listening to that <b title='a group of songs or pieces of music on a CD etc'>album</b> alone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(pause) Are we still talking about sex?

<i>Joey</i>And the most enjoyable. (only he laughs) Phoebe, say something!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Anyway, they want me to go down to <b title='used to mention sb/sth without giving a name'>this</b>- <b title='an image, esp of a baby that is still inside the womb, which is produced by ultrasound'>sonogram</b> thing with them tomorrow.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, remember back when life was simpler and she was just a <b title='↗gay, straight'>lesbian</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>God, those were the days!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So what're you gonna do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Aw, Mom...<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-<br>
<i>Monica</i>No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I-I think it might take some of the <b title='strong pressure on sb'>heat</b> off me.<br>
[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>What that Rachel did to her life... We <b title='run into - meet unexpectedly'>ran into</b> her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the <b title='a holy table in a church or temple'>altar</b>...<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's that supposed to mean?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Nothing! It's an expression.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No it's not.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were <b title='slightly fat in a way that looks healthy and attractive ↗skinny, slender, slim'>chubby</b>, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...<br>
[Time Lapse.]<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Look, there are people like Ross who need to <b title='set high goals for yourself'>shoot for the stars</b>, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- <b title='used to add emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, these are the people who never get cancer. They're happy with what they have. They're basically <b title='happy and satisfied'>content</b> like...cows.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Cows, dad?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>She knows how much I like cows.<br>
[Time Lapse.]<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. I'm telling you sweetheart you're gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you... daddy.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(turns on a <b title='a cordless vacuum cleaner [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustbuster">Wiki</a>]'>DustBuster</b>) Oh, so this does work! (Monica and Ross are in disbelief)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(trying <b title='desperate - willing to do anything to change a very bad situation'>desperately</b> to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (<b title='dig sth into sth - push a hard or pointed object into sth'>Digs her elbow into his hand</b>.) No news, no little <b title='anecdote - a short story based on your personal experience'>anecdotes</b> to share with the <b title='your parents and family'>folks</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pulls his hand away) Ok! Ok. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, <b title='used to describe a situation or what is happening.

She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.<br>
(Stunned silence <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(To Monica) And you knew about this?!
<s>Central Perk, everyone's there.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Folks are really that bad, huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, you know, these people are <b title='professional ≠amateur'>pros</b>. They know what they're doing, they <b title='take your time - do sth slowly or carefully without hurrying'>take their time</b>, they get the job done.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Must <b title='pass liquid waste from your body =urinate ↗bladder'>pee</b>. (Goes to pee.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, it's even worse when you're <b title='twin - one of two children born at the same time to the same mother'>twins</b>.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered-driven-career type.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, no, although I <b title='do - used to add emphasis'>did</b> have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='press switch'>Hit</b> the lights, please.<br>
(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up. Ross enters from the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>How long was I in there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm just cleaning up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, You uh, you need any help?<br>

Or, you know, uh, I can, hey!, I'll go down there, and-and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the <b title='obstetrics (the part of medical science that deals with the birth of children) / gynaecology (the study and treatment of medical conditions and illnesses that affect only women)'>OB/GYN</b>...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. Uh, when did it get so complicated?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="(You've) got me (there) - I don't know the answer">Got me</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Remember when we were in high school together?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet someone, fall in love- and that<b title='would'>'d</b> be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hmm... Me neither (He pulls up a <b title='a seat that has three or four legs, but no back or arms'>stool</b> so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)

<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Ross, Chandler, and Phoebe are there. Joey is working.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, remember when I had a monkey?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, what, what was I thinking?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(he's just picked up their bill) Hey! So, <b title='used to ask the reason for sth'>what's with</b> the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! You know what's even more generous than that?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I see where you're going!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used for asking sb for an explanation about sth'>What's up with</b> the <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins">Seven deadly sins</a>] the sins are usually given as wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony.'>greed</b> Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, look, I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> get these new <b title='head shot - a specific type of portrait. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot">Wiki</a>]'>head shots</b> made. And they're really expensive, you know? I'm <b title='finished, done'>down</b> to like three! Well, actually two <b title='because'>'cause</b> one of <b title='them'>'em</b> I kind of <b title='make sth black'>blackened</b> in some teeth- Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, is-isn't there something you can do to earn a little <b title='in addition to the usual or expected amount'>extra</b> money? I mean, can't-can't you <b title='get'>pick up</b>, I don't know, an extra <b title="sb's scheduled period of work">shift</b> here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, you know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got, you know, a little of this (she <b title='stick - put, move part of the body'>sticks</b> her <b title='↗breast, boob, bosom, tit, teat'>chest</b> out and shakes it) going on. Wow! I still have it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an <b title='a short performance that an actor etc gives in order to show their ability and suitability for a particular play etc'>audition</b> today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments <b title='from top to bottom, every part'>down</b> on me <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='reminisce - talk or think about pleasant events in your past'>reminiscing</b>) Ah, <b title="for Joey's stupidity">finally an explanation</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical <b title='things'>stuff</b>, remember? <b title='used when you are trying to remember sth =let me see'>Let's see</b> uh, well I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> donate <b title='semen (the thick, whitish, slightly sticky liquid that is produced by the male sex organs, and which contains sperm)'>sperm</b> again. (To Ross) I really prefer doing that at the home office you know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or <b title='↗sweat, snot, bogie, bogey, phlegm, mucus, pus, urine, saliva'>spit</b> or something, huh?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>(approaching with a tray with an order on it) Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uhh, do it?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>That guy (points) <b title='has'>'s</b> been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, <b title='↗presume, suppose'>assuming</b> that Joey will deliver it and walks away.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, <b title='used to talk about a particular stage in a conversation etc'>where</b> was I? (Takes a <b title='a very small amount of a drink ↗swig, down, gulp, gobble, gorge'>sip</b> of the coffee.)
<s>Central Perk, Ross is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter wearing <b title='a period of physical exercise'>workout</b> clothes.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what've you guys been <b title='occupied with, engaged in'>up to</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, kicking a guy in the <b title='the area between your legs where they join your body ↗groin'>crotch</b> all morning really <b title='ya - you. it - hatred, anger, anxiety, pressure etc. ↗get sth out of your system, digestive system, constellation, constipation'>takes it out of ya</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, now, we can <b title='defeat/punish anybody'>kick anybody's ass</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>After one class? I don't think so.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend you're a sexual <b title="sb who tries to use sb else's weakness to get advantages ↗prey">predator</b>! Go on! I <b title='try to persuade sb to prove that they are not afraid to do sth that is dangerous ↗challenge'>dare</b> ya!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Of course you could defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I study <b title='a Japanese sport or way of fighting [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate">Wiki</a>] ↗kung fu, judo, taekwondo, martial arts'>kara-tay</b> for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) <b title='The Japanese word for freshwater eels. The concept Ross is describing is Zanshin. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unagi">Wiki</a>'>unagi</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Isn't that a kind of <b title='a Japanese food that consists of small cakes of cold rice with fish, egg, or vegetables on top or inside'>sushi</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, it's a concept!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, maybe it means that too...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh!

(Rachel calmly wipes the <b title='the liquid in your mouth =spit'>spittle</b> off her face.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(To Phoebe) Ooh! You know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Well, as <b title='attractive or interesting'>appealing</b> as that <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross <b title='flash a look at sb - look at sb quickly and for a short time'>flashing</b> Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can't do that, we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>You guys!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take <b title='approval or praise'>credit</b> for?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock that's been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, <b title='whisker - long stiff hairs that grow near the mouth of a cat, mouse etc'>whiskers</b>, and two other socks <b title='sew_sewed_sewed/sewn'>sewn</b> onto it for ears.)

<i>Monica</i>Oh, yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do we have to make the entire thing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! Why, did you- you forget to make yours?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> pick-<b title='pick up - get'>pick it up</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (They kiss.) Ok, I can't wait! This is gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever! (Chandler <b title='giggle - laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way'>giggles</b> and exits.) I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ok, are you aware that, unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't <b title='think about a problem or situation until you find the answer'>figure out</b> what to make Monica.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm going crazy! Ok? Do you have any thing around here that looks <b title='home + made ↗homebrew'>homemade</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, you know what? She'd-she'd love this. (Picks up a model of <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Wiki</a>'>the Saturn V rocket</b>, that's the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it's an exact <b title='exact copy ↗miniature'>replica</b> of <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8">Wiki</a>'>Apollo 8</b>. I made it in the sixth grade.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I guess I <b title='if you say you could use sth, you mean you would really like to have it'>could use</b> that. I could say uh, your love sends me to the moon.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write umm, your love lets me <b title='travel in a curved path around a planet or star ↗eclipse, ellipse'>orbit</b> the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the famous <b title='like "sunrise", Earth + rise'>Earthrise</b> picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh.<br>
(Chandler leaves <b title='unhappy, disappointed, or sad ↗depressed, oppressed'>dejectedly</b>. When the door closes Rachel and Phoebe jump out from behind the curtains and scream...)<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>DANGER!<br>
(Ross screams like a little girl.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
<u></u>
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, he's still trying to figure out what to make Monica.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. Ok. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if he's giving it to her.) Yes honey, I've made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I can't do it. I can't do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A <b title='mixtape or mixed-tape is the generic name given to any compilation of songs [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix-tape">Wiki</a>]'>mixtape</b>! A mixtape!! (He runs out into the living room.)<br>
[Cut to the living room, Chandler is entering as Monica finishes wrapping her present for him on the kitchen table.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! Hi! Uh, you ready to exchange gifts?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure! Ok, you go first.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, come here! Come here, come here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, what a great gift! Is <b title='a song. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_You_Look_Tonight">Wiki</a>]'>The Way You Look Tonight</b> on it?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='briefly'>momentarily</b> <b title='↗horrified, scared, frightened'>terrified</b>) Maybe we'll have to listen and see!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, you ready to open yours?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
(He opens his present to find Phoebe's sock bunny from earlier.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's a sock bunny.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="used to say 'no' or 'not' in a less strong way ↗not so much, no way, nah, nope">Not really</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I did one time, and-and I wanna start doing it more. See that's what this is about.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I see. You know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes- that's uh- they're sock rabbits. <b title='bunny - a rabbit, used by children or when talking to children.'>They are completely different</b>- Ok! Ok! Ok! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, it's ok. I don't...<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no, it's not ok! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You <b title='go through - experience sth (diffcult/unpleasant)'>went through</b> all this time and effort to make this tape for me! You know I'm just gonna- I, I'm gonna 've to <b title='do sth to show that you are sorry'>make this up to</b> you! I will! I-I am going to cook you anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='think over - consider sth carefully before making a decision'>thinking it over</b>) Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape. (They both run into the bedroom and start to "<b title='make a marriage or relationship complete by having sex'>consummate</b> like bunnies".)
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, they are relaxing in sexual <b title='perfect happiness ↗bless, climax, orgasm'>bliss</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are <b title='by a large amount'>way</b> too young to 've seen that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oops! (Covers its eyes.) You know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, <b title='used to make a suggestion'>what do you say</b> I forget to get you a present for that too?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the <b title='bedside table'>nightstand</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You have done enough!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No you don't- get it in black, not brown.<br>
(The oven dings.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oop, your cake is ready!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oop!<br>
(They both get out of bed and go get some cake.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's like that old <b title='a sentence that people often say and that gives advice or information about human life and experience =proverb ↗moral, fable'>saying</b>, have sex, eat some cake.<br>
(As they approach the kitchen, the door opens and in walks in a Joey look-a-like.)<br>
<i>Joey's Lookalike</i>Hey Mon! Hey Chan! (He goes to the fridge) Just getting a <b title='a sweet drink containing bubbles'>soda</b>! (Does so.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who the hell are you?!<br>
<i>Joey's Lookalike</i>I'm Joey! How are you doing?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doing?! How you doing- Damn it Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, I gotta apologize <b title="instead of sb; because of/for sb">on behalf of</b> Carl.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who the hell is Carl?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know. look, I, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. You know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is... (Does the international hand symbol for so-so.) {The hand is held open and tilted from left to right. so-so gesture is a gesture whose origins are unknown.}<br>
<i>Monica</i>The only problem?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big <b title='a product line of beverages. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search?search=Minute+Maid">Wiki</a>]'>Minute Maid</b> <b title='ad'>commercial</b> a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he <b title='mess up - spoil/ruin'>messed it up</b>.<br>
<i>Carl</i>(sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Carl) Pizza! We like Pizza! Get out! (Carl does so.)
<s>Phoebe and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are returning.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Pat Sajak?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yep!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alex Trebek?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, of course!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Chuck Woolery?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ph- Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show_host">List of game show hosts</a>'>game show host</b>, whose ass I cannot kick.<br>
(They start to walk into the living room and notice someone's head sticking up from behind a chair. The camera cuts to the other side and we see it's Ross.)<br>
[Time lapse. The girls have Ross pinned face down. Phoebe is sitting on his back and arms while holding his head down and facing Rachel. Rachel is sitting on his knees and holding his lower legs vertically, causing Ross pain.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Say it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Say we are unagi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's not something you are! It's something you have!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Say it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a <b title='possibility ↗odds, probability, likelihood'>chance</b> you can get very, very hurt!<br>
(Rachel <b title='yank - suddenly pull sth quickly and with force'>yanks</b> on his legs again and he <b title='groan - make a long low sound =moan'>groans</b> in pain.)
<s>The Medical Research office, Joey is there with Carl in the waiting room. Two identical twins come out and both wave bye at the same time.</s>
<i>Joey</i>All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is this not gonna be?<br>
s<i>Carl</i>Another Minute Maid <b title='↗diaster, catastrophe'>fiasco</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's right! And what are you not gonna do?<br>
<i>Carl</i>Well, I'm not gonna talk because...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(gets very angry) Damn it Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey silences him with a <b title='a short low sound'>grunt</b>.)<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>(entering) (To the receptionist) Can I have the next one please? Thank you. (Takes the form.) Joey and Tony Tribbiani. (Joey and Carl stand up.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's us.<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>(seeing they're not identical) But uh, this is a study for identical twins.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's right, $2,000.<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>But, you're not identical twins.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Damn it Carl!
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica is getting ready for Chandler's arrival. He enters and finds the place lit with candles and dinner on the table.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my good God.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! Continuing the <b title='9, 7, 8, 6, ...'>countdown</b> of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, you have done enough! Ok? You have to stop this now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, the mixtape.<br>
(Monica pushes play and The Way You Look Tonight starts to play.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?<br>
(He hesitates, then goes over to dance with her.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You are just the <b title='sweet - kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweetest</b>. (They kiss.)<br>
(Suddenly, a strange and familiar voice comes out of the tape player. Here's a hint, OH...MY...GAWD! That's right, it's Janice!)<br>
<i>Janice</i>I love the way you look every night Chandler! (Monica breaks the kiss and Chandler freezes in terror.) That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love, Janice!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! You're the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
<s>A women's self-defense class, the instructor is just finishing a class.</s>
<i>The Instructor</i>Ok ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.<br>
(The women all clap and start to leave as Ross comes up to the instructor. <b title='according to the situation appears, although you cannot be sure ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b> he was hiding in the back.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a great class.<br>
<i>The Instructor</i>Thanks, man.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, you know, about that-that last move where that woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?<br>
<i>The Instructor</i>Well, then she'd take her keys and try to <b title='push sth somewhere using a lot of forces ↗stab'>jam</b> me...<br>

<i>The Instructor</i>Who? Me the attacker?<br>

<i>Ross</i>I tired attacking two women, did not work.<br>
<i>The Instructor</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I mean it's ok, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.<br>
<i>The Instructor</i>Let me <b title='understand the facts of a situation and be able to tell them correctly ↗set/put sb straight'>get this straight</b> <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>, you attacked your ex-wife?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, no! No-no! No, I tried! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He <b title='↗stare, gaze, glimpse, glance'>glares</b> at him.) That-that's a no.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is trying to explain himself to Monica.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>I am so, so, so, so sorry!<br>

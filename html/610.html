<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment, everyone except Ross is decorating the tree.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's a good story, Grandpa.<br>
(Ross enters)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>All</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow, Monica's letting other people <b title='help sb (to) do sth'>help decorate</b> her tree?! Did someone get her drunk again or?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Wiki</a>]'>Christmas</b> is about. It's about being with the people that you love.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That is nice and we're done. <b title='exclamation when sth is finished'>tada</b>!<br>
(Her side of the tree looks a complete mess)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know what it is, just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, here.<br>
(She turns the tree around so that her side, which is perfectly decorated, is showing)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See now it feels like Christmas!
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, everyone except Phoebe and Joey are there.</s>
<i>Ross</i>... and that's the story of the <b title='a top (=a toy that you spin) with a Hebrew letter on each of its four sides and a point at the bottom, used in a game played during Hanukkah (an eight-day Jewish holiday in November or December) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel">Wiki</a>]'>dreidel</b>. <b title="used to get sb's attention">Now</b>, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-Egypt_(orthographic_projection).svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Egypt_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/250px-Egypt_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png">'>Egyptians</b>, who used to bring green palm branches into their <b title='hut - a small simple shelter ↗cottage, cabin, Pizza Hut'>huts</b> on the shortest day of the year, symbolizing life's triumph over death.

<i>Rachel</i>So, <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> <b title='used for referring to a time that is not exact ↗sharp'>around</b> the same time that you started telling this story.<br>
(Joey enters)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Joe, <b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">what's up?</b><br>
<i>Joey</i>I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. You know, everywhere I look she's like... (He <b title='↗ape, copy, do, impersonate, mimic, mock, mime, simulate'>imitates</b> her stretching)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can see why that's hard to resist.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I like her so much!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know. And she's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. I just <b title='want to'>wanna</b> feed her grapes and brush her hair.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You are aware that she's, not a monkey, right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am so <b title='no longer having romantic feelings towards sb'>over</b> Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was <b title='sexy'>hot</b>, but now she's like old news!<br>
(Janine enters)<br>
<i>Janine</i>Hey guys!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Janine!<br>
<i>Janine</i>I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dicking Rocking Dickie Eve.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='wait ↗hold on'>Hold it</b>! Are you talking about <b title='an annual television special that airs every New Year&#039;s Eve on ABC. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Clark%27s_New_Year%27s_Rockin%27_Eve">Wiki</a>]'>Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve</b>?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Yeah, that's what they said.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I 've been watching it since I, I can remember!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you? (He kisses her on the cheek)<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-? you're gonna be a party person?! Those guys <b title='used to show that you strongly approve of sb/sth'>rock</b> the most!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my dance partner?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well actually they're <b title='recording'>taping</b> tomorrow. I don't really understand why.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, well you see, how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Square">Wiki</a>]'>Time Square</b> is actually <b title='↗pre-recorded'>live</b>, but they tape some of the party <b title='things'>stuff</b> ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you serious?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We are there!<br>
(Rachel laughs)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What, what are you laughing at?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I used to <b title='have a romantic relationship =go out with ↗ask out'>date</b> him, but you're still going out with her!<br>
(Gunther brings Janine a coffee)<br>
<i>Janine</i>Oh thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great! So we can all go together! I-I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> run. <b title='goodbye ↗see you later, see you, take care'>Catch you later</b>!<br>
(Janine leaves)<br>
<i>All</i>Bye!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Bye Janine!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Did she just ask me out on a date?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't think so.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What-what're you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the <b title='a period of 1000 years'>millennium</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Maybe. But hey, I know how I can find out. Well we're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! You know? But if she says '<b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed a <b title='a brand name for lip balm (oily liquid). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChapStick">Wiki</a>]'>ChapStick</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It was a dry day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Rachel) Oh my God!
<s>The <b title='a place where a movie or TV program is recorded'>Set</b>, Joey, Janine, Ross and Monica are walking in.</s>
<i>Joey</i>OK, <b title="used to get people's attention so they can hear what you are going to say">listen up</b>, I've been on sets <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. Important thing you remember- stay <b title='calm and not nervous'>cool</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='get - understand'>Got it</b>!<br>
(They get to the main stage)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God, it's just like I dreamed it!<br>
<i>Director</i>OK, everyone, gather up.<br>
(Monica and Ross push to the front)<br>
<i>Monica and Ross</i><b title='Excuse'>'Scuse</b> us.<br>
<i>Director</i>Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-yeah, I have a question. Uh when is this gonna <b title='broadcast '>air</b>?<br>
(He and Monica laugh)<br>
<i>Director</i>Yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys, over there, and I want you two <b title='exactly'>right</b> around here, and everyone else <b title='↗fan out'>spread out</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what? We'd rather not dance together because.. umm. see, we're brother and sister.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, it-it would seem <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> weird.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Director</i>Would it seem as weird as coming all the way down here <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> having to go home <b title='immediately / at the present time'>right now</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross! So when is it gonna air?
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel enter.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? That's terrible!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no, we do it every year!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, yeah, we never find them! She<b title='has'>'s</b> always <b title='best - defeat sb in a fight or competition ↗outwit'>bested</b> us that <b title='clever and willing to trick people in order to get what you want =cunning'>wily</b> <b title='a young woman who knows how to control other people to her advantage ↗lynx, shrewd'>minx</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, not ok, you can't look for Monica's presents!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But we have to!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, you don't have to, and you can't because I-I live here too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, then, you should look with us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I have a great idea for a present for her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='used to ask if sth has ended'>that's it?</b> (<b title='mimic - copy the way sb speaks or behaves, esp in order to make people laugh'>Mimics</b> Chandler) A great idea oh yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, that's not enough. I mean <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and <b title='a (large) number of'>a bunch of</b> little presents? And you've just <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If I help, we can find them faster!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's right!<br>
(Phoebe looks under the couch)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, ooh, we have a <b title='a person, thing, or situation which is particularly interesting, noteworthy, or urgent'>live one</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, it's a <b title='a mid-range to upscale chain of department stores. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s">Wiki</a>]'>Macy's</b> bag!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. (<b title='tip - make sth fall'>Tips</b> it upside down, and a shoe falls out) Ooh, who's it for?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd <b title='defeat'>break</b> you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-oh. She may <b title='know that we did sth wrong or committed a crime'>be onto us</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We are so gonna find them this year.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know when you guys said you were gonna go across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b> and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>No, we never do that.<br>
(They turn away and laugh quietly.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because that's where Joey gave me some <b title='things'>stuff</b> to store that I've never seen before in my life! Ok, that did not just happen! (He does a weird <b title='click + y'>clicky</b> motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)
<s>The Set, everyone is dancing.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, here comes another camera.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right. <b title='said when sth is not important or when you are not upset or angry about sth ↗no big deal'>No biggie</b>. <b title='used to tell sb to stay calm, or not to worry about sth'>Stay loose</b>.<br>
(As the camera passes by, they start to dance really <b title='stiff'>rigid</b>, but the camera is facing the other way.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why do they keep doing that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw! You know, if we wanna get on camera, we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right.<br>
(They move towards a platform, dancing really strangely as they go.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?<br>
<i>Girl</i>We learned how to dance.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on <b title='underwear for men and women worn on the lower half of the body'>underpants</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
(Camera <b title='pan - (of a film camera) to move slowly from one side to another or up and down'>pans</b> to Joey and Janine)<br>
<i>Janine</i>Hey! You're a good dancer!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, wh-what do you mean?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Like this.<br>
(She pulls Joey towards her and dances really close to him.)<br>
<i>Janine</i><b title='used to tell sb that they are doing sth correctly'>That's it</b>, feel the rhythm. That's better.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Director</i>(To Joey) Ok, you're dancing with that girl over there.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-no-no-no we came together!<br>
<i>Director</i>I don't see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-hey-hey, hey <b title='used to talk to a man or boy, esp one you do not know'>buddy</b>, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a <b title='chance'>shot</b>.<br>
<i>Director</i>Really, you think so? I don't.<br>
(He leaves, and this girl grabs Joey and starts dancing really wild.)

<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are there and Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>I couldn't find anything at Joey-Hey-hey, oh hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about <b title='because'>'cause</b> they're all <b title='rubbish'>crap</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Those are my gifts, I got those for you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh. Thanks, Chandler they're great!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Chandler, then what is this very weird, um metal A Z thing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Those are <b title='a pair of supports used to hold a row of books in an upright position by placing one at each end of the row.'>bookends</b>! That's a great gift!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, ok, I'm sorry, thank you for my <b title='sounds like "ass"'>azzz</b>. (Rachel laughs)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, ok, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!<br>
(Chandler does the weird clicky thing again.)
<s>The Set, the girl is still dancing with Joey.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey-hey dancer girl! Can, can I go to the <b title="↗restroom, ladies' room, men's room">bathroom</b>? I... (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, <b title='twirl - (make sb/sth) move in circles ↗whirl, whirlpool'>twirls</b> her round, and puts her against a platform) <b title='we go here'>Here we go</b>, see you girl. Oh-hey-hey! (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really <b title='not suitable for a particular situation or occasion ↗inappropriate'>out of place</b> dance) Looking good Gellers!<br>
<i>Ross</i>We know!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, the <b title='a snippy person is not patient and speaks to people in an angry way'>snippy</b> guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance <b title='beside or near'>by</b> him.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
(They dance over to him.)<br>
<i>Director</i>Ok, everybody <b title='stay at a particular position etc; not change'>hold</b>!<br>
(Ross and Monica high-five)<br>
<i>Director</i>Next on the platforms are... (He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where he's pointing to. He points away from them) ...you two! And... (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.) ...You two!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica! (Pause) Would it? (The director shakes his head.) How about me? (The director shakes his head again.)
<s>The Men's Bathroom, the tall guy is there as Joey enters.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Tall guy! Listen, I uh wanted to talk to you about that-that girl that you're dancing with.<br>
<i>Tall Guy</i>Uh she's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah, ok. Uh, loo-look buddy, I came with that girl, ok? And I had <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> plan to kiss her at the new years <b title='10..9..8..'>countdown</b>, I'm trying to <b title="win over - get sb's support or friendship by persuading them or being nice to them">win her over</b>, you know, so I was wondering-<br>
<i>Tall Guy</i>No I don't think so.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh come on man, you-you can dance with my partner, she's uh, she's real <b title='calm and relaxed'>mellow</b>!<br>
<i>Tall Guy</i>Look, you're- you dating this girl you came with?<br>

<i>Tall Guy</i>Nah, nah. She's <b title='Fair Game means the guy sees her as his sexual prey.

<i>Tall Guy</i>God! What are you, in second grade?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, man, you're the one who <b title='wet - urinate in your clothes'>wets</b> pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)
<s>Central Perk. Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe enter.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>You guys, <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, Monica would not hide the presents down here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, but she did. Look, there's that old <b title='sb in the 1960s who was opposed to war and the traditional attitudes of society, and who showed this by having long hair and wearing very informal clothes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">Wiki</a>]'>hippie</b> I've always wanted. (Points to an old hippie man.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know what? If they are here, Gunther knows about it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, and I could <b title='persuade him to give you information or money'>get it out of him</b>. He's had a huge <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i> No, no! That's not fair to play with his head, <b title='however'>though</b>. No, you do it, Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (walks over to Gunther and sits down) Hey Gunther. (puts her hand over his hand) Hi. (And she starts rubbing his hand.) <b title='get to - gradually start to'>Getting to</b> be that holiday time again huh?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>(he's looking down in shock at what Rachel is doing to him) Yes, it's like a <b title='an unusual and mysterious event that is thought to have been caused by a god; any very surprising and unexpected event'>miracle</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And you know, I was thinking, you know since it's the time of giving gifts, (starts <b title='stroke - move gently ↗caress, grope, feel up'>stroking</b> her finger on Gunther's hand for a second.) I was wondering are there any, presents around here for me? You know what I mean?<br>
[Across the room]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, I think I've found them. (She is standing next to a bin of toys.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's the <b title='a program run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve which distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_for_Tots">Wiki</a>]'>Toys for Tots</b> collection bin.<br>

<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The <b title='a set of movements etc that form part of a performance'>routine</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, we haven't done the routine since <b title='a school in the US for children between the ages of 11 and 14'>middle school</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Was it really that good?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-? we got <b title='a special honor in a competition for work that was of high quality but did not get a prize'>honorable mention</b> in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost <b title='not real. "they tape some of the party ahead of time."'>fake</b> midnight, do we really have any other choice?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, let's do it. Oh mom and dad are gonna be so <b title='face - accept that sth unpleasant is true'>faced</b>!<br>
(They move into a space, and Ross points to his eyes and then to hers)<br>
<i>Monica</i>5 6 7 8!<br>
(They start the routine. However hard I try, I really cannot describe it. You will have to watch it. I'm sorry.)<br>
(When they finish, they walk over to the director)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, do we really need to ask who's going up on the platform next?<br>
<i>Director</i>Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! (They run over to a platform)<br>
<i>Director</i>(To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, Dick's gonna want it for the <b title='an embarrassing public mistake'>blooper</b> show. (To everyone) <b title='=all right'>Alright</b>, cut!

<i>Tall Guy</i>Hey, guy, you got about three seconds to get away from my partner.<br>
<i>Director</i>Oh what's going on over here?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-ju, take a look at the guy's pants! Huh? I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he <b title='go overboard - do or say more than is reasonable or necessary ↗border, cross the line'>went a little overboard</b>?<br>
<i>Director</i>What's the matter with you? Get out of here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, <b title='used to tell sb rudely to go away'>take a hike</b> wetpants!<br>
(The director pushes the Tall Guy away)<br>
[Cut to Ross and Monica, who are finally on a platform!]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium">Wiki</a>]'>Millennium</b> moment!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! Hey, you haven't been practicing the routine, have you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! (They look at each other.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Me too!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe going into the robot, you know? (He mimics a robot)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, I think we should just <b title='keep to'>stick to</b> the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!<br>

[Cut to Monica and Ross who are dancing <b title='↗weird, bizarre'>oddly</b> on the platform with their ears covered, even though everyone's leaving.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, what did that snippy guy say?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, I think he's kicking out anyone who's not dancing. So just keep dancing. (They both uncover their ears and start dancing even more oddly.)

<i>Phoebe</i>Ha ha. You know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. Or we could just follow your clever jokes- any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Ok, come on, guys, show us where the presents are!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm, how about my azzz?<br>
(Rachel sits on the window seat, and knocks against it)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, this is hollow.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, don't look directly at them!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alright, no, we could look at them!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, this one's for me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And the big one's for me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, let's open them!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! Ok! Ok!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hee hee!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait a minute, wait-wait, we can't do this.<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>Why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't wanna know what Monica got me. You know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look, we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Whatever <b title='a character in a US cartoon strip called Peanuts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts">Wiki</a> <img src="195px-Lucy_KOs_Linus-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Lucy_KOs_Linus.jpg/195px-Lucy_KOs_Linus.jpg">'>Linus</b>, I'm opening mine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nobody is opening anything, ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put <b title='them'>'em</b> back?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Will you get us better gifts?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fine!<br>
(Monica enters, and they throw the gifts behind them.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? <b title='↗sarcastic'>Great!</b> Do you know how long it took me to find you that water <b title='sth used to remove dirty or harmful substances'>purifier</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's what you got me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.<br>
(Rachel leans over to look at him.)
<s>Joey and Janine's apartment, they both enter.</s>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say how nice it is to be in your own home'>Home sweet home</b>, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b> we uh, know how the New Year's gonna <b title='happen in a particular way'>go off</b>. I guess there's no reason for all that <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K">Year 2000 problem</a>'>Y2K panic</b>, you know? Anyway, good night!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Janine</i>(She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him) Happy New Year.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yoii. Wh-what was that for?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, I just really wanted to kiss you<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really? In the moment, I-I really wanted to kiss you too. I mean in the moment.<br>
<i>Janine</i>In the moment, huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, well. But only in the moment, yeah. So do you uh, wanna kiss again?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Me neither.<br>
<i>Joey</i>3, 2,<br>
<i>Janine</i>Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, ok. Except I, sort of felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.<br>
(They kiss to the music of <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne">a Scots poem written by Robert Burns in 1788</a>'>Auld Lang Syne</b>)
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment, everyone except Joey is there.</s>
<i>Monica</i>We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, oh, so Joey didn't get to kiss Janine?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nope, he sure didn't.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, so then I guess that mean that <b title='Ross and Joey'>you guys</b> are still <b title='if two players etc tie or are tied in a game or competition, they finish it with an equal number of points'>tied</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I don't know about that. I think she saw us do our routine. Yeah, I may have <b title='boogie - dance to pop music'>boogied</b> right into <b title='the first position in a competition'>the first place</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait a minute, so wh-, you guys are telling me that you actually did the routine from eighth grade?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. But, of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. 'Cause I was gonna say <b title='used to emphasize that you will not agree sth'>there's no way</b> you could've done <b title='the catching part'>the end</b> the way you guys did it back then!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? We could do it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can do it, ok? Come on, let's go. (She and Ross get up)<br>
<i>Monica and Ross</i>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by Monica, but she moves out of the way)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't do it! (Ross falls into Monica's guest room)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Now you do that, you're on TV.<br>

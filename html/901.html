<s>Rachel's Room, Joey moves Ross's coat to get the tissues Rachel wants and the engagement ring box Mrs. Geller gave him falls out of the pocket it was inside. Joey goes to one knee, picks up the box, opens it, and sees that it's an engagement ring.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey.<br>
(He turns to face Rachel on one knee with the box open.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Ok.<br>
(Joey is <b title='surprised or shocked'>stunned</b>.)<br>
[Cut to Ross getting of an <b title='↗escalator, lift'>elevator</b> carrying a <b title='a collection of flowers ↗bunch'>bouquet</b> of flowers and walking down the <b title='corridor'>hall</b> to Rachel's room.]<br>
[Cut back into Rachel's room.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So uh- I guess we should- make it official huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh- Look Rach- (Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey and look he brought flowers. Oh thanks Ross, I'm really more of a candy <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> guy. (Laughs.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh, I wanted to talk to you about something.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh Joey, can you give us just <b title='a very short period of time ↗a sec'>a minute</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who's here!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He pulled a quarter out of my ear!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, where's uh, where's mom?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>So when do I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. Wow.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh dad, Emma's in the <b title='an area in a hospital where new babies are taken care of until they go home'>nursery</b>. I'll take you now if you want, but (To Rachel) I really <b title='want to'>wanna</b> talk to you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I still need to talk to you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>About what?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See if you know what these guys are talking about.
<s>Outside the Nursery, everyone but Rachel is standing and looking into the window.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Isn't she beautiful?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Look at her, my first grandchild.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What about Ben?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica, <b title='mouth- form words with your mouth but not make any sound'>mouths</b>) Wow.<br>
<i>Monica</i>God, isn't she beautiful? Doesn't she look just like Rachel?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know everybody keeps saying that, but all I see is <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Vin_Diesel_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/220px-Vin_Diesel_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel">Wiki</a>] ↗bald'>Vin Diesel</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, what'd you think our baby would look like?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh God, please you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohhh...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But, it'll have my sense of humor.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her when you guys all came in the room.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yay! That's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, right.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh sure, ok, you can <b title='↗mastubrate'>touch yourself</b> in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh <b title='used to say you think sb has said sth false, silly etc'>please</b>! Just <b title='at an earlier time ↗then, after, once, since'>before</b> when you were asleep in the <b title='a public room in a hotel or other building ↗lobby, departure lounge'>lounge</b>! That, you know, that <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians">Wiki</a>]'>Armenian</b> family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my <b title='a handheld video game device [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameboy">Wiki</a>]'>Game Boy</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for <b title='a very short period of time ↗a minute'>a sec</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b> I just did something terrible.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That was you?! I thought it was Jack!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?! Why does she think that?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='because'>'Cause</b> it kinda looked like I did.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Again, what?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand- <br>
<i>Chandler</i>As we all are at some <b title='particular time'>point</b> during the day.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was <b title='propose- ask sb to marry you ↗engagement'>proposing</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross had a ring?! And he was <b title='going to'>gonna</b> propose?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know! I know! It's awful.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, what did she say?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(happily) She said yes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're smiling.<br>
<i>Joey</i> (Smiling) No I'm not.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes you are. I can <b title='recognize'>tell</b> by the way your mouth is. (Pause) Does Ross know?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh God, what the hell am I gonna tell him?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I like that. Yeah- <br>
<i>Chandler</i>If you <b title='clear up - explain/solve sth, or make it easier to understand'>clear things up</b> with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and <b title="kick sb' ass- beat/punish sb">kicks your ass</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughs) Now let's not get <b title='carry away- excite greatly'>carried away</b>. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I want a baby.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, we've been over this. I need to be <b title='face - be opposite sb/sth'>facing</b> <b title='from the opposite direction'>the other way</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah ok, but no <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreplay">Wiki</a>]'>foreplay</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='agreed ↗pact'>Deal</b>!<br>
[Back in front of the nursery window.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Dad, seriously! You know you really should see someone about <b title='↗fart, break wind, body odor'>that</b>!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Noted.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be ok alone for a bit?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(noticing something) Actually uh- (He turns Mr. Geller's head to look at Emma.)
<s>Rachel's Room, Phoebe is entering.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you all right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uhh- I think I just got engaged.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! He did it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well- did you know he was gonna ask me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you kidding? I'm like the one who <b title='talk sb into sth- persuade sb to do sth ↗talk out of'>talked him into it</b>. I like to think of myself as the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Swanage_Punch_%26_Judy.JPG/260px-Swanage_Punch_%26_Judy.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet">Wiki</a>]'>puppet</b> master of the group.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And you really think this is a good idea?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. I, the puppet master gets tired, people.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. I-I don't know! It just doesn't feel right.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why?! You two are so <b title='↗destiny, fate, doom'>meant to</b> be together, everybody thinks so.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?! Even Ross?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Especially Ross!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh you know what? I'll-I'll come back later. (He goes to leave but <b title='run into- meet unexpectedly ↗bump into'>runs into</b> Ross who's entering.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a <b title='when every seat in a theater etc is filled'>full house</b> here. I guess I'll just- I'll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='he goes there'>There he goes</b>, your <b title='↗fiancée'>fiancé</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I guess so.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Although he does play with himself in his sleep.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Can't say I'm surprised.
<s>A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a <b title='sb whose job is to look after a public building ↗superintendent, security, maid'>janitor</b>'s <b title='a small room or space'>closet</b> door.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Dad, what're you doing?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I think there are people in there having sex.<br>
(Ross turns to look at Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Can't be me, I'm standing <b title='exactly'>right</b> here.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Wanna <b title='look at sth quickly, esp secretly or from behind sth ↗peep'>peek</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Come on!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? I don't like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Ross) We're not peeking? (Follows him.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Well I'm peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello sir, you know Monica.
<s>Rachel's Room, she is taking the ring out of Ross's jacket, looks at it, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, uh, is it ok to come in?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Of course! Oh, Joey, this ring I- it's beautiful! I love it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> tell you.<br>
(There's a knock on the door and a nurse enters carrying Emma.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Nurse</i>Hey! Are you ready to try <b title='nurse- breastfeed'>nursing</b> again?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?<br>
<i>Nurse</i>It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dear Lord.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that- <br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh look, she's <b title='pull away- move the body or part of the body away from sb/sth'>pulling away</b> again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You-you know, I don't really know her.<br>
<i>Nurse</i>Why don't we try <b title='↗masseuse, masseur'>massaging</b> the breast to <b title='cause part of the body to function'>stimulate</b> the flow. (Does so.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To God) Are you kidding me?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's so <b title='making sb feel annoyed and impatient'>frustrating</b>! Why doesn't she want my breast?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know! Maybe she's crazy! (Storms out.)
<s>The <b title='↗lounge'>Lobby</b>, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh hey! <b title='wait ↗hang up - hang, help out - help'>Wait up</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Congratulations! I didn't wanna say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, that we had a baby? Uh, let's give him a little <b title='approval/praise'>credit</b>, although he <b title='used for emphasis'>did</b> eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's a secret? Oh <b title='a word used to express pleasure or excitement'>goodie</b>! Yes! Oh! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, Rachel and I are not engaged.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Um, I think you are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What're you talking about? Who told you that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel, your <b title='sb that sb else has agreed to marry'>betrothed</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We are not engaged.<br>
<i>Phoboe</i>Uh that's right, it's a secret. Ok. No, right, you are not engaged. I <b title='↗misleading'>misunderstood</b> her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, there is no secret. Ok? I didn't propose.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a <b title='↗PhD'>doctor</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pause) I am a doctor! You know what? I'm just gonna go and-and talk to Rachel myself.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, let me too. (They go into her room and see that she's sleeping.) Should we wake her up?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! No, come on, let her sleep! She's so <b title='↗fatigue, worn out'>exhausted</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Mouths "What?!", <b title='motion- give sb directions or instructions by moving your hand or head =signal ↗gesture'>motions</b> for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? You know Ross, doctors are supposed to be smart.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I didn't give her that ring!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You didn't?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So whose ring is it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's mine.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Is it an engagement ring?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But you didn't give it to her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But you were going to propose?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh, I might be losing interest in this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is see if she maybe- kinda- wanted ah- to start- things up again.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, what beautiful <b title='not very enthusiastic or interested ↗tepid'>lukewarm</b> <b title='belieft/attitude'>sentiment</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I didn't wanna rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how-how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume I was gonna propose, <b title='throw on - put on a quickly and carelessly'>throw it on</b>, and-and just start telling people?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I didn't! I didn't propose! (Pause) Unless uh- (Pause) Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and- it does sound like something I would do.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Look, we can't stay in here forever.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I just- I still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex! He didn't <b title='be able to go to an event'>make it</b> to one of my piano <b title='recital- a performance of music or poetry ↗recite, rehearsal'>recitals</b>, but this he sees!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is ok. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put on our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall <b title='surprised/shocked ↗dumbfounded, dumbstruck'>stunned</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi dad! I can still call you that right?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Of course. I'll always be your dad.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I just want you to know that what you <b title='witness- see sth happen'>witnessed</b> in there, that wasn't for fun.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It wasn't fun?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why- (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who <b title='have sex'>do it</b> whenever we want.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>The truth is, dad, we're-we're trying.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>To kill you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why? Why-why-would you-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We're trying to have a baby.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, we're trying to get <b title='↗contraception, contraceptive'>pregnant</b>.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) I'll guard the door!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, that's-that's ok dad, we-we can wait until later.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you <b title='ovulate- produce an egg from which a baby can be formed ↗ovary, womb, uterus, fertilization'>ovulating</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Daddy?!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Well you gotta <b title='discover information'>get at</b> it princess! When your mother and I were trying to <b title='become pregnant'>conceive</b> you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Seriously, sir, my brain's all over the wall.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Dad, I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b>, what I saw in the closet is not the <b title='↗best, optimal, maximum, minimum'>optimum</b> position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't feel good <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey asked me to marry him.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey proposed to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I-I said yes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sensing you won't <b title='organize a party'>throw</b> the <b title='baby shower- a party [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_shower">Wiki</a>]'>shower</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's- <b title="Rachel's engagement ring">It</b> is bigger than mine!<br>

<i>Monica</i>You can't marry him!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Well do you love him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I mean, whatever.<br>
<i>Monic</i>If you worry about breaking his heart again, I-I think it's still broken from the last time. I mean, So really, you're just, you know, taking the already broken pieces and breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces. (Pauses). Ok, <b title='stop thinking/worrying/caring about sth'>forget that</b>. Honey, the question is this- do you really wanna marry Joey?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. No, I don't. Could you be a <b title='sb who is kind and helpful ↗darling'>dear</b> and go tell him?
<s>A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, <b title='↗next, after that, afterwards'>and then</b> she took her breast out.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was <b title='block- shut out from view'>blocking</b> most of it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Go and tell Rachel <b title='immediately/at the present time'>right now</b> before Ross finds out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't wanna hurt her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, look, just do it gently.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way.

<i>Rachel</i>Uh- you didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Joey proposed to you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can come back.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes you did!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Actually, <b title='according to a strict way of understanding the meaning of a rule or set of facts'>technically</b>, I didn't.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well then why did you give me a ring?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait! Whoa-whoa, you- you gave her the ring?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, you did!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, I didn't!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, you did!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, I didn't!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, you did! And don't you say, "You didn't!"<br>

<i>Ross</i>Whoa! You were down on one knee?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But-but I didn't- I didn't propose!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Then what did happen?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, what did happen?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yes, you did!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, I didn't!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! (Screams) Ah! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Ross) I'll tell you about it later. Be <b title='calm and relaxed'>cool</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well then wait Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was gonna propose.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You were gonna propose to me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhh- No.<br>
(An awkward silence <b title='↗ensue'>follows</b>.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be <b title='difficult to deal with'>tricky</b> <b title='however'>though</b>, because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>Oh no, she said that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Um Joey? But, don't you think maybe it's kinda quick for you to you know be going away together on a trip?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Not for me! Nah, I, I wanna spend as much time with her as I can!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok honey, Joey, we need to talk, ok? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, that she's not looking for a serious relationship.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Where are you getting this?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, she told me. She said she's kind of a loner.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Oh.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I say we <b title='choose, accept'>go with</b> <b title='a song Janice want to sing at their wedding'>Careless Whisper</b>.<br>
(There's a knock on the door and Janice enters.)<br>
<i>Janice</i>Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Janice, what umm, what're you doing here?<br>
<i>Janice</i>Well umm, I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment but then I just felt I really couldn't be alone, tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and <b title='flee - leave somewhere very quickly ↗escape'>flees</b> in horror.) I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel like I need to be with family.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?<br>
<i>Janice</i>Please, it's 'cause otherwise I really don't know what I might do.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aren't you just a <b title='tiny ↗teensy-weensy, teeny-tiny, teeny'>teensy</b> bit curious?<br>
<i>Janice</i>(starting to cry) Do you have any <b title='tissue - a piece of soft thin paper, used esp for blowing your nose on ↗Kleenex, toilet paper'>tissues</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, in the bathroom.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Ok! (She runs for the bathroom)<br>
<i>Monica</i>We'll just... let her stay!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay, forever!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Kinda like your <b title='a type of recliner (a chair in which you can lean back at different angles) made in the U.S. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcalounger">Wiki</a>]'>Barcalounger</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>I never stop thinking about it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are we going to do?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing! We'll just have to let her stay!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We can't, we can't we gotta <b title='try hard to do sth'>fight</b>! We gotta (does funny <b title='gesture - a movement of part of your body, esp your hands or head, to show what you mean or how you feel'>gestures</b>, the Chandler way) fight!<br>

<i>Janice</i>Hey you guys, umm do either one of you wanna get in there before I take my bath?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honestly?

(Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)<br>
(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Monica.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!<br>
<i>Janice</i>Why?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because Chandler still has feelings for you!<br>
<i>Janice</i>He does?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗what, excuse me, pardon, sorry'>Say again</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right. That's right. And that is why, you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Feelings, such strong feelings.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh... my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I'm so sorry, I'll go. (Starts for the door.) Goodbye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this <b title='pooper - buttocks/anus ↗go to hell'>goes in the pooper</b>. (Hurries out.)

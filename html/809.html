<s>Joey and Rachel's, Joey is reading What to Expect When You<b title='if a woman is expecting, she is going to have a baby ↗delivery, labor'>'re Expecting</b> as Rachel enters from her bedroom.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(looking at her fingers) Oh my...God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughing) You <b title='be tricked into believing sth that is not true'>fall for</b> it every time!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look, I brought you my old <b title='the state of being or becoming a mother'>maternity</b> clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Pheebs that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> (Grabs a pair of pants) Ooh, those are so cute!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see, how they expand as the baby grows? (There's a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby's born, they're great for <b title='shoplift - take sth from a shop without paying for it'>shoplifting</b> melons.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Oh, oh good you're all here. Ok, <b title='celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States and on the second Monday of October in Canada. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving">Wiki</a>]'>Thanksgiving</b> tomorrow, four o'clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>He was in Ross's class...<b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/TTUband.jpg/300px-TTUband.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band">Wiki</a>]'>marching band</b>... was <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) <b title='used when changing the subject of a conversation'>Anyway</b>, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go, so I invited him here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh that's nice.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, oh, and by the way, he's lost <b title='a (usu larage) number of'>a bunch of</b> weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Ok, I mean really, really <b title='extremely attractive ↗cute, hot'>gorgeous</b>! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wouldn't hurt you to say it <b title='sometimes, not often ↗(every) now and then, from time to time, at time, occasionally'>once in a while</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, ok, I also, <b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b>, I'm not <b title='going to'>gonna</b> make a turkey this year.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious! <b title='used to add more information, besides'>Plus</b>, you know, eating them is like a tradition. You know, it goes back to the very first Thanksgiving when the Indians sat down with the cowboys.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh right... That's when they had that big <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/StampedeRodeo2002.JPG/300px-StampedeRodeo2002.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo">Wiki</a>]'>rodeo</b> at <b title='the traditional site of disembarkation of William Bradford and the Mayflower Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620.

<i>Monica</i>All right! Ok, it's just Phoebe. Will's still <b title='If you are on a diet, you eat special kinds of food or you eat less food than usual because you are trying to lose weight.'>on a diet</b>, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her <b title='strong dislike'>aversion</b> to <b title='birds, such as chickens, that are bred for their eggs and meat'>poultry</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>She is?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, did you remember I had to leave the room <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> when you had that roast chicken?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. But I thought that was just <b title='because'>'cause</b> I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Ok? It's just- It's a lot of work.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like <b title='Independence Day [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_of_July">Wiki</a>]'>Fourth of July</b> with no apple pie! Or-or Friday with no two pizzas!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be <b title='a lot of'>a ton</b> <b title='food remaining after a meal'>leftover</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, you're telling me you can eat almost an entire turkey in one <b title='a period of time during which a meal is served'>sitting</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) This is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or, or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damn it! We can eat!
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching football, and it's actually the right game <b title='The Green Bay Packers are an American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Wisconsin_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Wisconsin_in_United_States.svg/270px-Wisconsin_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Green Bay</b> at <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions ↗Michigan <img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">'>Detroit</b> (although not this year's), as Monica is getting everything ready.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, isn't it weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You too!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Anything I can do to help?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really <b title='be into sth - like and be interested in sth'>into</b> the game so I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a <b title='↗pile, heap, mound'>stack</b> of them.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how's the game?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I've no idea.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to <b title='help'>help out</b> with <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>

<i>Chandler</i><b title='No'>Nope</b>! <b title='↗every now and then, from time to time, at times'>Every once in a while</b> I just yell and scream stuff at the TV.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah! Anderson just <b title='score - win point in a sport etc'>scored</b> again! (To Phoebe) There's no Anderson.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well I wanna <b title='take part in'>get in on</b> this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you <b title='in spite of what has been said or expected'>after all</b>, I didn't realize this game was on.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I didn't know you like football.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well normally I don't, but you know...(looks at the TV)...Green Bay is playing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You like Green Bay?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well it's only like my favorite bay! (Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin'>Wisconsin</b> winter only lasts from August to June.)<br>
(Phoebe joins Chandler on the couch as there is a knock on the door which Monica answers.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Will</i>Hey!<br>
(Oh, I should point out that the live studio audience at this point goes absolutely wild. And I had absolutely no idea that this Will character was that popular! Maybe they should make him the seventh friend. Which would <b title='prove effective or successful'>work out</b> just fine since he's already married to <b title='Rachel Green played by Jennifer Aniston'>one of them</b>. Will is played by some guy named <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt">Wiki</a>]'>Brad Pitt</b>, I guess he's some sort of actor.)<br>
<i>Will</i>Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aww thanks! God, Will I'm so glad that you came! You just, you look great! You must've lost like...<br>
<i>Will</i>150 pounds. Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those <b title='an American fast food restaurant franchise that primarily sells submarine sandwiches (subs) and salads. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_%28restaurant%29">Wiki</a>]'>Subway</b> sandwich commercials.<br>

<i>Will</i>Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy...it's no good. Throw it out.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.<br>
<i>Will</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really <b title="interested in a subject or activity">into</b> the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my <b title='the opinion that you have about yourself ↗self-esteem, self-respect'>ego</b> if we didn't stand <b title='exactly'>right</b> next to each other.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='nonchalant - not feeling or showing interest or enthusiasm'>nonchalantly</b> <b title='glance - look quickly'>glancing</b>) Hey. (Turns back around.) (To herself) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Will) Wanna give me a hand?<br>
<i>Will</i>Sure! Monica, I <b title='be shocked, surprised, amused etc by'>can't get over</b> how great you look! You look <b title='extremely beautiful ↗incredible, phenomenal, marvellous, amazing, astonishing'>stunning</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh umm, I <b title='mean to - intend to'>meant to</b> tell you, Ross is coming.<br>
<i>Will</i>Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)<br>
<i>Will</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is there a problem?<br>
<i>Will</i>No. Uh, it's ok. It's just uh, God I hated her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Will</i>Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No, Will, no!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Phoebe) You know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh come on!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Noooo! Damn you <b title='referee ↗umpire, judge'>ref</b>! You <b title='[<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130214044143AAR3rNC">link</a>]'>burn in hell</b>!<br>
(Joey enters eating potato chips.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, what're you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to <b title='prepare for physical exercise or a performance by doing gentle exercises or practice'>warm up</b> my stomach first. Eating chips is like stretching.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.<br>
<i>Will</i>I actually know what you're talking about. I'm here to tell you something, friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that <b title='If you describe a situation or a feeling as a void, you mean that it seems empty because there is nothing interesting or worthwhile about it'>void</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, this is Will. From high school. This is Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey! (to Will) Chip?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Will!<br>
<i>Will</i>Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey-hey you came! <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, you look incredible! <b title='an attractive person ↗hottie'>Hot stuff</b>! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?<br>
<i>Will</i>It's good to see you <b title='used as a familiar form of address for a man'>man</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you <b title='occupied or busy with'>up to</b>?<br>
<i>Will</i>I'm a <b title='commodity - a product or a raw material that can be bought and sold'>commodities</b> <b title='sb whose job is to organize business deals for other people'>broker</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.<br>
<i>Will</i>Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh! Man, I, I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.<br>
<i>Will</i>That was such a fun night!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. It would've been good if we had <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> in, but still, real fun.<br>
<i>Will</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Will</i>God we were <b title='boring, bad, uncool'>lame</b> back then. You remember how into dinosaurs we were?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughs) Yeah.<br>
<i>Will</i>So what you, what you do now?<br>
<i>Ross</i>So how long are you in town?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)<br>
<i>Will</i>(<b title="glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">glaring</b> at Rachel) Rachel Green.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be ok?<br>
<i>Will</i>Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Will, high school was-was a long time ago.<br>
<i>Will</i>Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and <b title='In food science and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch (such as cereals, bread, and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, jams, and desserts).

<i>Rachel</i>(sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's Will from high school!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! Really got that sexy, <b title='smoulder - burn slowly without a flame'>smouldering</b> thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to <b title='move your lips as if you were saying sth, but without making a sound'>mouth</b> something to me, but I can't <b title='make sth out - manage to see/read sth'>make it out</b>. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, dinner's ready!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Good game!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. <b title='solid - excellent, high-quality; difficult. A solid achievement or solid work is of real, practical, and continuing value'>Solid effort</b>. Solid effort.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, so who won?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='simultaneous - happen at exactly the same time'>simultaneously</b>) Green Bay.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(simultaneously) Detroit.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well the <b title='The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions">Wiki</a>]'>Lions</b> technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...<b title='A legendary sea creature having the head and upper body of a man and the tail of a fish ↗mermaid'>Mermen</b>.<br>

(They sit down at the table and Will goes to talk to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! Will, right?<br>
<i>Will</i>Right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Right. Hi! I'm Rachel Green.<br>
<i>Will</i>Oh I-I remember you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time <b title="can't place sb - recognize sb, but be unable to remember where you have met them before ↗recall, recollection, memorize, ring a bell, learn by heart">placing</b> you.

<i>Monica</i>(breaking it up) Uh, Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit <b title='very far'>way</b> over there. (The other side of the table.)<br>
(Monica sets something on the table and removes the cover. It kinda looks like turkey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's about <b title='8.6 kg'>nineteen pounds</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Rachel) It's like me when I was born.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?<br>
<i>Will</i>Oh, you'd like that wouldn't <b title='you'>ya</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh, you know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just <b title='an expression of disgust ↗eww'>yuck</b>!<br>
<i>Will</i>(sneeze talks) <b title='↗classic'>Typical</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='used for asking sb to repeat sth that you have not heard clearly ↗excuse me, pardon'>I'm sorry</b>. What?<br>
<i>Will</i>I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair <b title='a short, quick movement'>flip</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Umm, I'm sorry. Do you had-do you have a problem with me?<br>
<i>Will</i>I don't know? Do I? Do I?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I think you do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Rachel) <b title='according to what you have heard or read ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b> you were umm, a little <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> to him in high school.<br>
<i>Will</i>A little mean? You made my life miserable!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...<br>
<i>Will</i>Well you should be. <b title='exclamation of abandon (fuck it)'>Screw it</b>! Bring on the yams!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...<br>
<i>Will</i>Yams!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts <b title='dish out - serve food onto plates for a meal'>dishing out</b> a large <b title='an amount of food that is served to one person at a meal =serving'>helping</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh Will umm, I just wanna say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school...<br>
<i>Will</i>Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You had a club?!<br>
<i>Will</i>That's right, Yeah I Hate Rachel Green Club!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?<br>
<i>Will</i>Me, and Ross. (Points at Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No need to point, she knows who Ross is.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?<br>
<i>Will</i>Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_five">Wiki</a>]'>high five</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No no.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So who else was in this club?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastically</b>) You guys were cool.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So Ross, we <b title='go out - have a romantic relationship with sb'>went out</b> for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.<br>
<i>Will</i>You went out with her?! We had a <b title='agreement ↗deal'>pact</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That was in high school! It's not like it was <b title='if an agreement, contract, decision etc is binding, you must do what it says ↗breach'>binding</b> forever.<br>
<i>Will</i>Then why did it have the word <b title='time without end'>eternity</b> in it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm thinking of joining an "I Hate Turkey Club"... although I do love a <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_sandwich">Club sandwich</a>]'>turkey club</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Monica, did you know about this?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I swear I didn't. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?<br>
<i>Ross and Will</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hmm, a little <b title='feeling happy because you are no longer worried about sth (they were gay in this case)'>relieved</b>, I gotta say.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look Rach I-I'm sorry, ok? I...I was a stupid kid, ok? The only reason I joined...<br>
<i>Will</i><b title='together with'>Co</b>-founded!<br>
<i>Ross</i>...co-founded. Co-founded the club was that I-I was <b title='extremely'>insanely</b> in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.<br>
<i>Will</i>Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?<br>
<i>Will</i>Well, we did a little more than that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No no! No no. No no.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! What-what else did you do?<br>
<i>Will</i>We started a <b title='↗gossip'>rumor</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What rumor?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>It's no big deal</b>. We-we...said that- the rumor was...that umm...you had both...male and female <b title='relating to the process of having babies or producing young animals or plants ↗genitals'>reproductive</b> parts.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Will</i>That's right! We said your parents <b title='flip - make a flat object such as a coin go upwards and turn over in the air =toss'>flipped</b> a coin, decided to <b title='bring up'>raise</b> you as a girl, but you still had <b title='↗clitoris'>a hint of a penis</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(shocked) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You started that?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Everyone at our school heard it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Everybody at my school heard it! You were the <b title='a plant, animal or person with both male and female sex organs'>hermaphrodite</b> cheerleader from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island">Wiki</a>]'>Long Island</b>?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no! Oh my God! This is all <b title='make sense - be reasonable/sensible ↗logical'>making so much sense</b> to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (<b title='motion - signal or direct by a movement or gesture'>Motions</b> to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Actually, Billy Tratt is <b title='↗lesbian, straight, heterosexual, homosexual, come out (of the closet)'>gay</b> now. So-so that one's not really our fault.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, <b title='why'>how come</b> you never told me this?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.<br>
(Joey is now looking at Rachel, and since Rachel's standing and he's sitting down and he's not looking at her face... You get the picture.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof. Come on, <b title='whip sth out - jerk (make part of your body move with a quick sudden movement) sth out ↗flash'>whip it out</b>.<br>

Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my <b title='a book containing pictures of people and the activities they did at a school or college during one particular year'>yearbook</b> <b title='freshman, sophomore, ..., junior, senior'>senior</b> year, "Dear Rach, you're such a great person."

<i>Monica</i>Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b> with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey! What were you doing in the library?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>They had magazines!<br>
<i>Will</i>Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! She didn't look 50!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did she look 16?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! (They all look.) Wow!<br>
<i>Ross</i>She didn't photograph well!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So how did this happen? Did she, did she <b title='persuade sb to do sth by making it look very attractive ↗seduce, tempt, lewd'>lure</b> you to an early bird dinner?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us.

And <b title='used to explain how a series of events caused sth to happen without giving any details'>one thing led to another</b>.

<i>Ross</i>Only when it was <b title='slightly wet ↗humid'>damp</b>! (To Rachel) I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! You know what? (To Will) I'm back in the club!<br>

<i>Monica</i>All right, listen, you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school. I mean, everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Tootsie-Roll-WU.jpg/220px-Tootsie-Roll-WU.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tootsie_Roll">Wiki</a>]'>Tootsie Roll</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow...<br>
<i>Monica</i>And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!<br>
<i>Ross</i>As a <b title='romance - have or to try to have a romantic relationship with sb'>romancer</b> of the elderly.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could <b title='recognize'>tell</b> she used to be pretty.<br>
<i>Ross</i>The eyes...<b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> still <b title='shine brightly'>sparkle</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey guys, this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And <b title='at the present time'>right now</b> you got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can-can't you just <b title='let go - stop holding/thinking/etc sth'>let this go</b>?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Goes over and <b title='↗cuddle, huddle, snuggle, embrace'>hugs</b> him.) It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right where's that turkey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey! Those are my <b title='↗fraternity, masculinity, paternity'>maternity</b> pants!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

<i>Joey</i>Well <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>that's it</b>. I'm done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) Here come the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Is there anything we can do for you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, just, nobody press on my stomach.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You can keep those pants by the way.<br>
(Joey notices Monica has gotten a pie.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ah, just cut me a little <b title='a very small thin piece of sth ↗slice, silver'>sliver</b>. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger.

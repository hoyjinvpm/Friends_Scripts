<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah she made it <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> clear, it is not going to happen.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, all right, then, I guess I shouldn't get too excited about the fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!<br>

<i>Janine</i>I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Janine</i>I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be really late for dance class!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Janine</i>Ok, now I'm really late. (Gets up.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, all right, ok. But uh, hey, can you just, just leave your lips? (She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)<br>
<i>Janine</i>(to Monica and Rachel) Bye.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bye. (Janine exits.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Have you kissed her yet? It's <b title='↗awe, awful'>awesome</b>! You know, I could do it forever! You know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I am so glad you said cooks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look-look, it's like imagine your best kiss ever. (They start thinking about it.) Right? Ok, now, multiply that, by, like 10. (They start to have bigger smiles on their faces.) Huh?

<i>Rachel</i>Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.) Uh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You got it from Pottery Barn?!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='angry and surprised because you feel insulted or unfairly treated'>indignant</b>) I was tired!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, she hates all <b title='produced in large numbers using machinery'>mass-produced</b> stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the <b title='a city in the U.S. state of New York [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Plains,_New_York">Wiki</a>]'>White Plains</b> store.<br>

<i>Monica</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>- If you put that in her apartment <b title='used to say that sb will continue to talk about sth for a long time'>you'll never hear the end of it</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok fine! I'll-I'll just tell her that it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 <b title='compact disc [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc">Wiki</a>]'>CDs</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of <b title='{literary} long ago'>yore</b>...<br>

<i>Monica</i>I am so glad you guys <b title='if two people get together, they start a romantic or sexual relationship ↗get along'>got together</b>, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look at us, we're a couple of couples!<br>
<i>Janine</i>I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And Chandler, I can't believe I let you pay for this one. (They <b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle, snuggle'>hug</b> and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks again <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, you guys <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='↗come by, stop by'>come over</b> tomorrow?

<i>Janine</i>Oh that would be great!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, but hey, look, at least let us bring the wine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, you don't have to!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok, we'll see you tomorrow!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Can't wait! (They each go into their <b title='relating or belonging to each of the individual people or things you have just mentioned'>respective</b> apartments.)<br>
[Cut to Joey and Janine's.]<br>
<i>Janine</i>How are we gonna get out of that one?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Janine</i>I can't handle two nights <b title='follow one after the other without any interruptions =consecutively'>in a row</b> with them.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?<br>
<i>Janine</i>I don't know, they're just a little <b title='boring'>blah</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Blah?!<br>
<i>Janine</i>You know, he's blah, she's just- she's very loud for such a small person.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't <b title='spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hang out</b> with them? <b title='Because'>'Cause</b> that'd be kind of a problem.<br>
<i>Janine</i>No. Of course we can still hang out with them. Just, you know, not two nights in a row. Ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Thank you. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hmm. If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.

<i>Rachel</i>I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her that ours was an original.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why did you do that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because she <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hates</b> Pottery Barn.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I know. I <b title='go - become'>went</b> a little crazy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh, look at that! The <b title='designed to be used as decoration'>ornamental</b> bird cage! Large!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(sees Ross) Oh, Ross, no. Be careful, that is very old! Ok? Early <b title='colonial buildings and furniture are made in a style that was common in North America in the 18th century'>colonial</b> bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(glaring at Rachel) <b title='very interesting'>Fascinating</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating <b title='equipment'>apparatus</b> from colonial times.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from the colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well there's yore. And uh, you know, <b title='{literary} a time in the past'>yesteryear</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah no, <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b> Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, you know, if you <b title='at any time'>ever</b> decide to redecorate- And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh honey he doesn't need my help.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The uh cheap <b title='knockoff - a cheap copy of a popular product'>knockoffs</b> and dinosaur <b title='old or broken things, things that you do not want or like ↗rubbish, crap'>junk</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, you know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(not sure of what to do) You know what? I don't, I don't really think Phoebe wants to come.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> want to!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, she does want to.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She does want to.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! I'm gonna get my <b title='handbag'>purse</b>. (Runs to her room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Hey, hey, can I have all this stuff when she makes you throw it out?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, sure, and I'll show you were you can put it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>O..(thinks about what she meant.)

<i>Rachel</i>Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
(They walk by a Pottery Barn window display.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='an expression of disgust ↗yuck, eww'>Uck</b>, look at this! Pottery Barn, uck!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you know what? Don't look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don't look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, that fan <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> looks like ours. And the birdcage and the... wait a <b title='a very short period of time'>sec</b>! This is our exact living room!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... (Looks <b title='↗frustration'>desperately</b> for something different.) We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that <b title='movable wall'>screen</b> is you know, on the other side.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God. Oh my God, this is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! No! Eww-eww, it's all right, I did, I'm sorry, I just, Phoebe, I wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on, don't be mad.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong <b title='concerning, relating'>with</b> the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room, and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='get - understand'>gets</b> it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, that's right!<br>
(They start to go inside.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But at least the apothecary table is real.

<i>Joey</i>Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?<br>
<i>Janine</i>Well I did. I really did. And you know, guys, I gotta say, I'm sorry if I was a little, weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's totally understandable.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, don't worry about it.<br>
<i>Janine</i>So we can go out again?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Absolutely!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Oh good.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh well, good night!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)<br>
[Cut to Joey and Janine's, they're entering.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>See? Eh, wasn't that fun?<br>
<i>Janine</i>We have got to move!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='burst - move suddenly ↗storm in'>bursting</b> in) I knew it! You know, you're not so quiet yourself, <b title='an affectionate or sometimes criticizing form of address to a young girl'>missy</b>!<br>

<i>Janine</i>You know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah blah blah."<br>
<i>Monica</i>(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let's go! <b title='at the present time/immediately ↗just now, by now, right away'>Right now</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! Enough! Enough! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) You know I really think you could <b title='defeat in a fight'>take</b> her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Janine) You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway! (They exit.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, uh, we-we got a-a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.<br>
<i>Janine</i>They said stuff to me too, you know!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know! I know! And-and I'm gonna talk to them about it. But look, they mean so much to me. They... They're like my <b title='a group of people who live together and are related to one another'>family</b> you know? If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work ok? It can't. (Starts to <b title='lose control of the emotions'>break up</b>) I'm very upset.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Ok. Ok. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah! That, that'd be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)<br>
[Cut to the hallway, Janine is entering as Monica is taking out the garbage.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>What did I tell you about the hall?!<br>
<i>Janine</i>I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Great.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I'm glad we <b title='work out - solve a problem'>worked things out</b>.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right.<br>
<i>Janine</i>Ok, I'll see you.<br>

<i>Janine</i>(<b title='mutter - speak in a low voice ↗mumble, stutter'>muttering</b> to herself) Or <b title="You're loud.">I'll hear you</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(hearing that) <b title='That does it - used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>That's it</b> big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(chasing her) You'd better run!<br>
(Joey and Chandler both come into the hallway.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did you hear that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know, I'm sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! (They head downstairs.)
<s>Central Perk, Ross, Chandler, and Monica are there along with Ross.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Monica) You know, I'm not sure you could've taken Janine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='scoff - laugh or say things to show that you think sb/sth is stupid or deserves no respect'>scoffs</b>) I could've taken her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. She's much bigger than you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you kidding me?! I know what to do with tall girls. You <b title='attack'>go for</b> their knees!<br>
(Joey enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>How you doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey so, did uh, did she move out?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pretty much, yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I cannot believe you just <b title='↗dump'>broke up</b> with her just like that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, when it's not right, you know it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what would cheer you up?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm giving this lecture on <b title='erosion - process by which rock or soil is gradually destroyed by wind, rain, or the sea.'>erosion</b> theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Joey? Are you in there?<br>
[Cut to inside Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler and Joey are eating breakfast.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>(hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That's Rachel!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, you have to talk to her!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after <b title='↗the other day - a few days ago'>the other night</b>, it's just it's...too weird, ok? Don't tell her I'm here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Plain-Bagel.jpg/250px-Plain-Bagel.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel">Wiki</a>]'>bagel</b> falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don't eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Rach!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Is Joey here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't see him. (To Monica) You see him?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? <b title='no ↗nah'>Nope</b>! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, at least you make each other laugh.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he you know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We were playing a game.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?! No! No!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. Well listen, if you see Joey, will you just tell him that uh...tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Joey) Ok, did you hear that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, I don't know. That's a <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> small <b title='↗girth, circumference'>hole</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> talk to her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't! You know? Look, you guys don't know what it's like to <b title='make an effort to do sth'>put yourself out</b> there like that and just get <b title="shoot down - say or show that sb's ideas or opinions are wrong or stupid ↗turn down">shot down</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='unable or unwilling to believe sth'>incredulous</b>) I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh <b title='shit'>crap</b>!"<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at <b title='a weight loss camp [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_camp">Wiki</a>]'>fat camp</b>! <b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, kids are <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> when they're hungry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right so, so what'll I do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is Rachel. I mean, what are you <b title='going to'>gonna</b> do, never talk to her again? I know it's weird, it's awkward, bu-but you gotta at least try.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Ok. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your<b title='penis'>...</b><br>
<i>Chandler</i>(interrupting him) We didn't play it!
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Phoebe is holding a book as she, Rachel, and Monica drink some tea as Chandler looks on.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your <b title='plural of "leaf"'>leaves</b> and tell you your fortune.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I didn't know you read tea leaves.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so <b title='↗exact, precise'>accurate</b>. You know, and-and you know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's <b title='good or impressive in a surprising way ↗amazing'>wondrous</b> <b title='↗predict, un-, -ability'>unpredictability</b>. You know? And also tea tends to give me the <b title='=diarrhea.

<i>Monica</i>Ok, I'm done. Read mine.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='surprised, shocked ↗dumbfounded, dumbstruck'>stunned</b>) I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, I'm done. Do mine.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Ok, I see a circle.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What<b title='does'>'s</b> yours say Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm... Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button down, like a, a faded <b title='a pale pink-orange color. The flesh of the salmon fish is salmon-colored. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_%28color%29">Wiki</a>]'>salmon</b> color?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You mean your pink shirt?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Faded salmon color.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I'm sure you get another one at <b title='an American clothing retailer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Taylor_(clothing_retailer)">Wiki</a>]'>Ann Taylor</b>'s.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's my favorite shirt! Ok? I love that shirt!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well just ask Mona to give it back!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things on such good <b title='conditions, relationship'>terms</b>. And if I went over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, <b title='jump up your ass - go fuck yourself'>jump up my own ass</b> and die. (Walks away.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(noticing a guy sitting by the green <b title='a vertical stick or pole fixed into the ground'>post</b> looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been seen that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, same dry cleaner's; maybe he's the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally <b title='check out - look at, get information'>checked you out</b>! He is so <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b>! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of <b title='an American disco group [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_People">Wiki</a>]'>The Village People</b>, what's that mean?<br>
(Joey enters.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
(He slowly walks to the other side of the couch and sits down at the table, an awkward silence follows.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
(More awkward silence.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is cooking as Rachel <b title='pace - walk first in one direction and then in another many times, esp because you are nervous'>paces</b> nervously.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>So I thought Joey and I would be ok once we <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hung out</b>, but it's like we don't even know how to be with each other <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>. And by the way, I-I've been meaning to say this. If you guys knew about this, a little <b title='warning'>heads-up</b> would've been nice. Just a little. You know "Joey loves you, be prepared".<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, for next time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know it's <b title='difficult'>tough</b> now, but things will get better.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How do you know that? <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>What if</b> it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not great at the advice, can I introduce you in a <b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastic</b> <b title='↗remark'>comment</b>? Some cheese?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, what is the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen">Wiki</a>]'>Bruce Springsteen</b> CD in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kat_stevens">Wiki</a>]'>Cat Stevens</b> case?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, where is the Cat Stevens CD?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>In the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Taylor">Wiki</a>]'>James Taylor</b> case.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Where is the James Taylor CD?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. No need to panic. Deep breath everyone. Ok umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, if we're gonna do that we should <b title='think of'>come up with</b> some kind of order. You know alphabetically or, or by <b title='↗style, type'>genre</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hmm, I don't know. I think we really have to talk this through.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God!! You guys have such problems! I feel so terrible for you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I'm-I'm sorry. Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah. That <b title='make sense - be sensible/reasonable ↗logical'>makes sense</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, like, I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, I can do that. I can do that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the <b title='an American TV crime drama series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice">Wiki</a>]'>Miami Vice</b> <b title='the recorded music from a movie etc'>soundtrack</b>? Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They were just <b title='give away - give sth to sb because you do not want or need it for yourself'>giving those away</b> at the store (off Monica's look) in exchange for money.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can <b title='help you'>help you out</b> with your, with your big work problem.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a <b title='↗scratch, dandruff'>head scratcher</b>. Wow! (To Chandler) You know what, if we're gonna <b title='make it - succeed in getting somewhere in time for sth'>make dinner</b> we're gonna have to leave. Yeah. Joey, maybe you could help her out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh and you know what, while you're helping solve this problem, you might <b title='want to'>wanna</b> do something with your hands, like umm, I don't know, <b title='if you say sth off the top of your head, you say it immediately, without thinking carefully about it or checking the facts'>off the top of my head</b> err... maybe put the CDs in the right cases.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to say that sth is happening again in the way that you expected, esp sth unpleasant / we go here'>Here we go</b>.<br>
(He leads her out the room)<br>
<i>Joey</i>So you uh, have a...big work problem?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's you know-it's nothing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Huh. Ok. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I'm gonna <b title='leave'>take off</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah-no wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, and um, and my baby.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>My boss wants to buy my baby!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! Oh my-oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know I told you, it's a really big problem.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What, he wants to buy your baby?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Can you believe that?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's crazy!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's what I told him!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, how did this <b title='used for emphasis'>even</b> happen?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well I'll tell <b title='you'>ya</b>! (Pause) See, uh my-my boss and uh, and his wife-They-they <b title='↗sterile, infertile, surrogate, adoption'>can't have children</b>. So, umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I wanna buy your baby."<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I <b title='thought'>figured</b> it was something about <b title='Parental leave is an employee benefit that provides paid or unpaid time off work to care for a child or make arrangements for the child&#039;s welfare. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_leave">Wiki</a>]'>maternity leave</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and they exchange information.)

<s>Outside Mona's Apartment, Ross is knocking on the door.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Mona? (There's no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches <b title='on top of'>atop</b> a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to <b title='make a long, high-pitched sound ↗scream, screech, squeak, shriek'>squeal</b> in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona's apartment.) Ok, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (thinks of and answer) Upstream. Damn, nobody's here for my good <b title='jokes'>ones</b>. (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he <b title='dive - go deeper/lower, move quickly ↗duck'>dives</b> behind the couch.)<br>
<i>Mona</i>(entering, with her <b title='sb who you have a date (romantic meeting) with'>date</b>) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.<br>

<i>Mona</i>No, it's still wet. You know what? Let me get it out before it <b title='set - (of liquid) become hard and solid'>sets</b>. Ooh, I have something you could wear. Here. (Hands him Ross's shirt.)<br>
<i>Mona's Date</i>Oh umm, I-I don't know if I wanna wear a woman shirt.<br>
<i>Mona</i>No-no, that-that's a man shirt.<br>
<i>Mona's Date</i>Awfully pink. (Ross <b title='mouth - form words with your mouth but not make any sound'>mouths</b>, "It's salmon!")

<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah? The work problem?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What problem did you tell him you had?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh that's, that's not important. The <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b> is, I really-I think everything's gonna be ok.

<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Guy</i>I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what're you gonna do?<br>
<i>Guy</i>I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) <b title='You have finally had a good idea'>Now you're talking</b>.<br>
<i>Guy</i>Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(looking around) She must've left.

<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So? What-what-what happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's all gonna be ok. They're just so happy that I'm not <b title='↗sue, litigious'>suing</b> them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. <b title='=as long as'>So long as</b> I understand that the money should not <b title='construe - understand in a particular way ↗interpret, conjure'>construed</b> as a <b title='the initial portion of the total amount [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_payment">Wiki</a>] ↗deposit'>down payment</b> on this or any other child I may <b title='When a woman bears a child, she gives birth to him or her ↗labor, delivery'>bear</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, can you give us a minute?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know. I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> worked. I mean, you know, I don't know about you but I haven't thought about our thing since all this.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah I know! I miss that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I <b title='make an effort to do sth ↗court'>put myself out</b> there and said all that <b title='things'>stuff</b> and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.<br>
(Awkward silence.)<br>

(There's a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen, come here, come-. (She does so.) I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I- But you know, what did I tell you about leaving your key outside the door like that? I mean you're lucky it was me and not someone else. I guess lucky is-is too strong a word. Anyway, Mona I-I'm really, really sorry. It's just... (He picks up the pink shirt.)<br>
<i>Mona</i>(interrupting him) Listen Ross, you-you don't have to apologize. I-I understand why you were there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You do?<br>
<i>Mona</i>Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you too. And I wish we could <b title='work out - solve a problem'>work it out</b> Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just... It just wasn't meant to be.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(faking starting to cry) Oh God you're right.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Ross, we...we have to be strong. Ok, I-I'm gonna go. (She picks up the shirt Ross has just <b title='put'>set</b> down.) Can I? To remember you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)<br>

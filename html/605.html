<i>Chandler</i>Ok, let me just <b title='interrupt sb or suddenly join a conversation ↗barge in'>jump in</b> and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, come on, if-if you think about it, it's actually kind of funny. (He laughs, and he laughs alone.) Ok, maybe it's best not to think about it.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I just think, uh things would go a lot <b title='more "smooth"'>smoother</b> if we each have our own zone, you know? Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.

<i>Judge</i>Well, based on what I've heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you don't wanna be together you'll have to file for divorce.<br>

<i>Monica</i>All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're babysitting!<br>
<i>Monica</i>The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be ok on your own for a while!<br>

<i>Joey</i>(to women passing him) Porsche.<br>
(Ross and Rachel approach, they're still yelling at each other.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That is totally your fault!<br>
<i>Ross</i>My fault?! You threatened the judge!<br>

Ok, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll <b title='make you feel healthy and full of energy'>set you up</b> with a nice clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Ok, I'm sorry. I didn't <b title='↗on purpose, accidental, happen to, by chance'>mean to</b> scare you. I just have to clean that up. Ok? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, <b title='used to say that a particular situation or person cannot be changed'>that's just the way things go</b>. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Ok, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has <b title='manage to - succeed in doing sth ↗make it'>managed to</b> crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit <b title='a mischievous person, esp a child, enjoys having fun by causing trouble ↗naughty'>mischievous</b>! <b title='used for showing that you are surprised or a little annoyed'>My gosh</b>! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting <b title='↗urine, feces'>in the drawer</b>.) Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.)

<i>Chandler</i>Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. (The time for the sonic blaster gun to pass his digestive system.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed them, bathed them, and put them to bed.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And protected them from a tornado?<br>
(Monica enters and her jaw drops in horror.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're right, you're right, I shouldn't <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak out</b>. 'Cause this is what's gonna be like when you and I have babies! When will that be?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!

<i>Ross</i>I picked up the divorce <b title='documents'>papers</b>. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, little 'X's! Great! That <b title='make a bad situation better'>makes up for</b> everything!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, I-I- you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! Right!<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing. (Sits down.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, can we just sign, please?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross <b title='yank - suddenly pull sth quickly and with force ↗jerk'>yanks</b> each page out of the way.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok wait Ross, we're- wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little <b title='when you admit that you have done sth wrong or illegal'>confession</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh.. well you know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-well, remember how, we were too drunk to remember anything that night we were married?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't wanna say anything, but it just kinda, kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason you thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us, into this whole thing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So then if-if- I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your fault.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, don't <b title='take a big risk by doing sth that is likely to cause you trouble'>push it</b> though.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I gotta say, I know I'd divorce a lot of women, never thought I'd be divorcing you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. I always thought if you and I got married, that would be the one that <b title='stick - remain persistently or permanently'>stuck</b>. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut">Wiki</a>]'>Pizza Hut</b>. (They both laugh.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Good. Although you know, he-he's a private guy. You know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of <b title='pickle - vegetables or fruit which have been preserved in a vinegar sauce or salty water'>pickles</b> that won't open.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So what are you saying; I should <b title='flow ↗rinse'>run</b> him under hot water and bang his head against a table? {The metal lids expand more than the glass jars.}<br>

<i>Ross</i>What?! Why?!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I guess it could.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well then I think that's it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, if that's what you want you, then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.

<i>Paul</i>I'm thinking that you are looking really fine in that dress.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah that's great Paul, but you know, I wanna know what- (Puts her hands on his shoulders) Wow, <b title='His muscles ↗pecs, abs, biceps'>those</b> are really great!

<i>Rachel</i>That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Ok, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go. (Gets up to leave, but Paul doesn't move.)<br>
<i>Paul</i>It was horrible. They called me <b title='↗coward, chicken out'>chicken</b> boy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
[Time <b title='a period of time passing between two things happening'>Lapse</b>, Paul is now weeping uncontrollably in Rachel's arms.]<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Nothing! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been to and I can't find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring!

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Why did you give your credit card to Jey?<br>

{yeti - large hairy man-like or bear-like creature reported to live in the highest part of the Himalayas}
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Monica and Chandler are <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b> on one of the chairs.</s>
<i>Joey</i>(Entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aren't you supposed to be at an <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b> for another hour?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Ok, look, if I have to pretend that I don't know about you two, then you two are <b title='going to'>gonna</b> have to pretend there's nothing to know about.<br>
<i>Chandler and Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry.<br>
(They wait for Joey to go into his room and close the door and then start making out again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(from the bedroom) I can hear that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) Rachel's at work.<br>
(They both go to her apartment.)<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can still hear you!
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are there as Phoebe enters carrying a large box.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, what's that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, my mom sent me a family <b title='a valuable or special possession that has belonged to one family for many years ↗will'>heirloom</b> that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms <b title="=for Christ's sake (used for emphasis)">for crying out loud</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, the heirloom I ever got was a <b title='a fashion accessory that is usu worn wrapped around the neck like a scarf [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather_boa">Wiki</a>] <img src="200px-Gabriela_Poet_Wearing_Boa_by_Patty_Mooney-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Gabriela_Poet_Wearing_Boa_by_Patty_Mooney.jpg/200px-Gabriela_Poet_Wearing_Boa_by_Patty_Mooney.jpg"> ↗corba, serpent'>feather boa</b>. Got it from my dad. He got it from his dad. How did I ever get born?<br>
(Phoebe puts her leg up on the chair and removes this huge knife from her boot to open the box with. The guys are shocked at the knife's existence.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Eeeee- (She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a fur coat.) ohh! God! (She throws it at Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Argh-argh! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this <b title='a small animal that is raised for its thick fur [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-American_Mink-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/American_Mink.jpg/220px-American_Mink.jpg">'>mink</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me <b title='used for emphasis'>but</b> <b title='used to make negatives and questions stronger'>at all</b>?! <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b>, I-I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, just some 9-year-old <b title='sb from the Philippines'>Filipino</b> kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him <b title='with your eyes wide open, esp because you are surprised or frightened ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshop">Sweatshop / sweat factory</a>]'>wide-eyed</b>. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I <b title='make up - invent sth, esp in order to deceive sb'>made that up</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't <b title='put a picture, notice etc on a wall so that people can see it'>put up</b> <b title='a small sheet of paper advertising sth ↗booklet, leaflet, pamphlet, poster'>flyers</b> in here.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='Why'>How come</b>? Everybody else does.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>You can't.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's- Emily thinks we should get all new <b title='things'>stuff</b>. Stuff that's just ours, together. You know <b title='completely new, not yet used'>brand new</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-touched sale.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Touched. Used. Sat on. Slept on.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>I'll take it all.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Ross, you're ok with that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, but don't you think this is a little extreme?<br>
<i>Ross</i>After what I did? Can you blame her?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! You <b title='if sb gets off, they are not punished for doing sth wrong, or they receive only a small punishment'>got off</b> easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she <b title='curse - ask God or a magical power to harm sb ↗cast, spell'>cursed</b> him and turned his <b title='used for referring sth, say, his penis'>thingy</b> green.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I guess I'm lucky Emily is not <b title='↗witch, wizard, wand'>magic</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, she is. We all are.<br>
(Ross suddenly gets up and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the <b title='to check his thingy?'>bathroom</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily thinks Ross's furniture's got Rachel <b title='coodie - body louse (a small insect that lives on the hair or skin of people or animals)'>coodies</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Calm down, Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! Everything's getting all <b title='mess up - damage, spoil'>messed up</b>, you know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, <b title='for this reason ↗thus, therefore'>hence</b> Ross stops seeing us!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said <b title='↗so'>hence</b>...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, I'm not happy about this either, but, you know if-if Ross says he's happy then, we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you <b title='calm and not nervous, upset, or excited'>cool</b> with that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! But you know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool. Probably be some of the hardest acting I've ever done. Maybe I'll play it with a <b title='↗beard, sideburns, goatee'>mustache</b>. (Chandler makes a frustrated <b title='↗motion, signal'>gesture</b>.)
<s>The Storage Room in the basement of Monica and Rachel's building, Monica and Rachel are looking for something.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, whoa, God! Storage rooms <b title='if a person or place gives you the creeps, they make you feel nervous and a little frightened ↗goosebumps, spooky, psycho'>give me the creeps</b>! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, if you want the little round <b title='waffle - a flat cake, marked with a pattern of deep squares'>waffles</b>, you gotta have to wait until I find the little <b title='a cooking appliance used to make waffles. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_iron">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Waffle_iron-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Waffle_iron.JPG/220px-Waffle_iron.JPG">'>waffle iron</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I want the little round waffles.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of <b title='used to kill cockroaches, fleas, and flying insects by filling an area with insecticide [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bomb">Wiki</a>]'>bug bomb</b>. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of a poison?<br>
(The single light <b title='flicker - burn or shine with an unsteady light that goes on and off quickly'>flickers</b> and <b title='go out - stop burning or shining'>goes out</b>. Leaving the room in total darkness.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, you know what? I'll-I'll have toast!<br>
(She starts to run out but is stopped by a <b title='shape of body'>figure</b> <b title='loom - appear as a large unclear shape'>looming</b> out of the darkness carrying a <b title='a large tool that you use for breaking up the ground <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Pickaxe.jpg/220px-Pickaxe.jpg">'>pickaxe</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Arghhhh!!<br>
(They both start screaming <b title="at the top of one's lungs - as loudly as one's voice will allow.">at the top of their lungs</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! <b title='cover or envelop with or as if with fog'>Fog</b> him! Fog him!<br>
(Rachel grabs the bug bomb, activates it, throws it at the figure, and they both run out through the fog.)
<s>Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'll take it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That might work! (She gives him the coat.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Well, her thought is, and I agree, <b title='new and therefore interesting or exciting ↗brand new'>fresh new</b> furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?

(She <b title='↗pull on - put on quickly, pull off'>puts the coat on</b> and starts to <b title='mannequin'>model</b> it.)

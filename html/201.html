<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so this is <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> what<b title='has'>'s</b> happened <b title='until now'>so far</b>. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of <b title="get in the way - prevent sth from happening">got in the way</b>, like cats, and Italian guys. And finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his <b title='↗excavate'>dig</b>, Chandler <b title='tell sb sth secret by mistake'>let it slip</b> that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?

<i>Rachel</i>Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Please! Excuse me! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a <b title="a long seat">bench</b> and falls down.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with the flowers.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're-you're bleeding.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Anyway, enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from <b title="the countries of eastern Asia, esp China and Japan">the Orient</b>. I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> hear everything! (Looks at Julie) Everything!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, where do I start? Well, this is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.<br>

<i>Julie</i>(Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.<br>

<i>Julie</i>Well, Ross and I were in <b title='=graduate, sb who has completed a university degree ↗postgraduate'>grad</b> school together.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So what <b title='used to show that you are very surprised'>the hell</b> happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, <b title='develop in your life, and change your relationships, interests, activities etc'>move on</b>. You know whose voice that was?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>God?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It was you, <b title='a close friend'>pal</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh! No.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Previously on Friends...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How did the job <b title='things'>stuff</b> <b title='happen'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>He offered me one.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>) You know what? This <b title='call for - need'>calls for</b> a bottle of <b title="Israel's finest champagne">Israel's finest</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The job is in Paris. (we see Ross <b title="↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">stare</b> in disbelief)<br>
(Fade out)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So if you take this job you'll be, you'll be moving to Paris?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Or facing a <b title='a difficult situation or problem ↗pickle'>bitch</b> of a <b title='the journey to work every day'>commute</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an <b title='extremely good =unbelievable'>incredible</b> opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll <b title='fly out - take people or goods somewhere by plane'>fly you out</b>... Anything we want.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my <b title='a small enclosed area in a room ↗booth, stall'>cubicle</b>. (Monica looks at him and can't really <b title='say how good or important you think sb/sth is'>place</b> what he just said)<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, we'll <b title='work out - solve a problem ↗figure out'>work it out</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh thank you! Thank you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, what's going on?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I got a really incredible job offer.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, great! All right!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to praise sb for doing sth well'>Good for you</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's in Paris.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, ok? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler) <b title='used to say what happens next'>and then</b>, and these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, it <b title='come and go - be present for a short time and then go away'>comes and goes</b>. I wouldn't trust it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you guys, this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to <b title='accept a suggestion, idea etc'>get on board</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course we can. Congratulations. (they <b title='↗snuggle, cuddle, huddle, embrace'>hug</b>, but Joey shakes his head.) Yay! (she <b title='gesture - make a movement with your hands or head in order to show or tell sb sth ↗signal, motion, mouth, mime'>gestures</b> Joey to come and join in) Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No no, no, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so-<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and Rachel follows him)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You ok with this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it makes me feel sad, but-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Talking to Ross.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I <b title='understand'>see</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How-how can I be ok with this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, but what are we <b title='going to'>gonna</b> do? She really needs this job.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you think if uh, if the <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren">Wiki</a>'>Ralph Lauren</b> people offered her her old job back, she would take it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>How is that gonna happen?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I,I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I-I met him at that Christmas party. Um, we-we really <b title='have a good friendly relationship ↗get along'>hit it off</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I didn't say we were brothers.<br>
(Rachel and Joey come in. Rachel is hugging Joey from behind.)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>Technically</b> this is not a hug!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>. Phoebe's reading a newspaper.</s>
<i>Gunther</i>You read the <b title="obituary - a report in a newspaper that announces sb's death and gives a short description of their life and achievements">obituaries</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh, yeah, well, I-I got a few <b title='curse - magic words which are intended to bring bad luck to sb ↗cast, spell, sorcerer, wizard, witch'>curses</b> on people. I just like to see how they're <b title='come - happen'>coming</b>.<br>
(Chandler and Monica walk in.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, Phoebe. Hey, all right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York">Wiki</a>]'>Westchester</b>? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We close <b title='money, property, or a legal document that is kept by sb until a particular thing has happened ↗deposit, down'>escrow</b> tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily <b title='↗puzzled, perplexed, bemused, bewildered'>confused</b>. We're not very <b title='intelligent and able to learn things quickly ↗smart, clever, brilliant'>bright</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> it is better than ours? Should we at least look?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What'd you think Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a <b title='an American global ice cream parlor (a name used by some businesses) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskin_Robbins">Wiki</a>]'>Baskin Robbins</b>. <b title='used when you want to end a conversation or leave a place'>Anyway</b>. Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She died.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're kidding!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's terrible!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly <b title='done by one person alone'>solo</b> across the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Wiki</a>]'>Atlantic</b>. (Chandler and Monica look <b title='↗confused, perplexed, bemused, bewildered'>puzzled</b>) Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, she was just an agent.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey's gonna be so upset.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already <b title='flip out - become very anxious, upset or afraid =freak out'>flipping out</b> about everything that's changing. This-this'll push him over the edge.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>What if</b> he reads it in the paper?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Unless <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoopy">Wiki</a>] ↗comic strip Peanuts'>Snoopy</b> says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're ok.
<s>Ralph Lauren. Mr. Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the door and enters.</s>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>May I help you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we-we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Oh right, Don?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Close. Ron. (shakes hands)<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Uh, what can I do for you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhm, well, I'm here to <b title='find out information'>see</b> if-if you'll give Rachel her job back.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Wow, that is <b title='used for describing sth that makes you feel you would like to have it or do it ↗temptation, lure, entice'>tempting</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>She is good!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(surprised) Huh, I took a <b title='attempt, try'>shot</b> there.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. Ah, it's not true, there's... there's nothing I want to do.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I see. Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr. Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, nothing, it's just, it's uh, it's close to Ron. Does he um.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs <b title='used esp in questions, to ask whether sth is true, possible etc'>by any chance</b>?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and, and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it how you must've heard it and that's not good. Uhm, let me start again. I'm a <b title='paleontology - the study of fossils'>paleontologist</b>, eh, you'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones. <b title='fossil - a bone, a shell or the shape of a plant or animal which has been preserved in rock for a very long period'>fossils</b>!<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>You can really arrange that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You let Rachel come back, and it's done.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your, your kid is gonna <b title='If you have the time of your life, you enjoy yourself very much'>have the time of his life</b>.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's-he's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's <b title='unable to stop thinking about sth'>obsessed</b> with dinosaurs.<br>
<i>Ross</i>He'll be fine.
<s>Central Perk. Phoebe's reading, Joey has just entered the room.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Pheebs.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey. Everything ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm just mad at my agent.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Estelle? Why?<br>
<i>Joey</i>There's a <b title='role, character'>part</b> in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be <b title='suggest sb as a suitable person to be elected to a position'>put up for</b> it! She'd better have a good reason.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm-I'm guessing she does.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well (taking his cellphone out of a pocket) I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> hear it, because she keeps doing this.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I love that <b title='a well-known statement =proverb ↗fable, moral'>saying</b>!<br>
(Phoebe is outside, taking her cellphone out of her bag and making a call. Joey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing).<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Phoebe (<b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mimic, mock, simulate'>doing</b> Estelle)</i>Joey, it's Estelle.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I was just gonna call you! That's weird.<br>
<i>Phoebe-Estelle</i>It's a little <b title='conicidence - the fact of two things happening at the same time by chance, in a surprising way'>coincidental</b>, but believable. (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b> for that TV movie.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, actually I am!<br>
<i>Phoebe-Estelle</i>I guess I <b title='drop the ball - make a mistake (like in a ball game)'>dropped the ball there</b>. <b title='oops - said when sb falls or makes a small mistake ↗uh-oh'>Whoopsie</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say that sth is completely finished or that a situation cannot be changed'>That's it</b>? You know, it seems all you do <b title='recently'>lately</b> is drop the ball.<br>
<i>Phoebe-Estelle</i>Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, look. All I'm saying is you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.<br>
<i>Phoebe-Estelle</i>What're you saying?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm saying that (pause). This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used as an exclamation ↗boy, my'>Man</b>, <b title='difficult ↗rough'>tough</b> week for Estelle!

<s>Joey's apartment. Rachel's there and Ross enters the room with a <b title='a stuffed toy is a toy sewn from a textile, and stuffed with a soft material.'>stuffed dinosaur</b>.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Emma left her stuffed <b title='The species Tyrannosaurus rex is commonly abbreviated to T. rex[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus">Wiki</a>]'>T. rex</b> at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nooo!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, it was <b title='used for emphasis. FRIENDS also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word "so" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRIENDS">Wiki</a>]'>so</b> weirdest thing. They fired me and then <b title='happening or appearing suddenly ↗out of the blue, all of a sudden'>out of nowhere</b> they just hire me back! I mean, that place must just've been <b title='fall apart - if an organization, system, relationship etc falls apart, it stops being effective or successful'>falling apart</b> without me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, you-you're not going to Paris.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I'm still going.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh... wh...what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, when, when the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton">Wiki</a>]'>Louis Vuitton</b> people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeeeah! (They <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_five">Wiki</a>]'>high-five</b>)
<s>House next to the one the Bings are moving into. Chandler and Monica knock, a lady opens the door.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.<br>
<i>Lady</i>Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>, but please, look around.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a <b title='sexy ↗cute, gorgeous'>hot</b>, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! Uh, what a <b title='an unpleasant place'>hole</b>!<br>
<i>Lady</i>So? What'd you think?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Love it!<br>
<i>Lady</i>Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is going to make another one.<br>
<i>Monica</i>They could be our neighbors, what-what're they like?<br>
<i>Lady</i>Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, uh, he's on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street">Wiki</a>]'>Wall Street</b> and she's on-<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh my God!<br>
(Chandler and Monica are speechless).<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Monica) Sure.
<s>Joey's apartment. He's there and Phoebe comes in.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Joey, you wanna come with me to- are you ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be killing her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, that wouldn't kill her. <b title='relating to the heart =cardiac'>Coronary</b> <b title='blood clot (a mass of blood cells)'>embolism</b> might.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> <b title='stay close with'>stick with</b> me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, no, no! You don't, don't call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which... is the key, to a happy heart.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(impressed) <b title="I'm very impressed by it">You blow me away</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves)
<s>The house Monica and Chandler are viewing. Janice comes down the stairs.</s>
<i>Janice</i>What a small world!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And yet I never <b title='meet unexpectedly'>run into</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonce">Wiki</a>]'>Beyonce</b>!<br>
<i><b title='real estate agent ↗listing/selling agent'>Realtor</b></i>You two know each other?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Don't <b title='criticize'>judge</b> me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why not? I do.<br>
<i>Janice</i>So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a <b title='when you bid for goods, esp in an auction'>bidding</b> war? I'd better warn you, I'm a <b title='sb who is physically or mentally strong'>toughie</b> (playfully <b title='punch - hit'>punches</b> Chandler, who tries to get away from her)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! Don't, don't do that. (looks <b title='very annoyed or upset by sth'>disgusted</b>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(looks confused and scared) I don't know why.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Ooh, that decides it then. I was <b title='undecided as to which of two sides to support (to buy, or not to buy in this case)'>on the fence</b>. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! (Chandler and Monica are <b title='↗completely, totally, absolutely, entirely'>utterly</b> shocked) Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This can not be happening!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe <b title='Janice and her husband'>the Janice's</b> won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">Wiki</a>]'>Hitlers</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Thinks a little more) Ok, Ok, (clapping her hands) All right. <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>What if</b> we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound <b title='unpleasant/offensive'>distasteful</b>, but when did you start <b title='crap - pass solid waste from your body ↗poo, poop'>crapping</b> money?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, you <b title='think of'>come up with</b> an idea.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='=all right'>Alright</b> alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But we love our house.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the, just the <b title='↗creak'>crickets</b> and (apes Janice's voice) "Oh My God"!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, but if we don't get this house, she's still gonna <b title='show up means the same as show'>show up</b> wherever we go!

(She shows this with her index finger, mimicking pushing something up)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)

<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) Look, I um, I know Rachel <b title='turn down - refuse to consider an offer, a proposal etc ↗pass'>turned you down</b> but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.<br>

<s>Joey's apartment. He walks in reading his mail, and plays back his messages on the answering machine.</s>
<i>Answering machine</i>Joey, this is Al Zebooker, (Looks annoyed that he called him) the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle <b title='pass away - avoid saying "die"'>passed away</b>. (Looks shocked) I wanted to let you know there's a <b title='an event of of remembering a person or people who have died'>memorial</b> for her at the Westside <b title='a small church ↗cathedral'>chapel</b>, tomorrow at ten.

<i>Joey</i>Estelle?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's <b title='anger towards sb'>no hard feelings</b> for firing me.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) "out of area". <b title='used as an exclamation ↗man'>Boy</b>, <b title='used for expressing agreement in a very definite way'>I'll say</b>.

<i>Janice</i>Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely <b title='put in - officially make'>putting in</b> an offer on the house and <b title='used to say you are sure about sth'>I'll bet</b> we get it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The Hitlers will be so disappointed.<br>
<i>Janice</i>All right, I gotta <b title='leave/go ↗take off'>run</b>. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='very shocked or upset'>stunned</b>) Obviously.<br>

<i>Janice</i>Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.<br>

<s>Ross's apartment. Ross is working on his laptop when Rachel enters with Emma.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You are never going to believe what happened to me today.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.<br>
<i>Ross</i>They did?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ye-s. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back.

<i>Ross</i>Right!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely. Ohh!

I'm fine going back to a job where I've <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhm, I hadn't no you, I hadn't no idea you were, you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you-you said you were scared.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared <b title='however'>though</b>, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uh, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(after a long pause) You should go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's what you want. You should go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You really think so?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I really do.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But I already told Zelner that I would come back.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(picks up a <b title='face without skin, the bone structure that forms the head ↗skeleton, torso'>skull</b> of some <b title='any animal that eats meat ↗herbivore, omnivore'>carnivore</b> from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll understand.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Then I'm happy too. (They hug. Fade out)

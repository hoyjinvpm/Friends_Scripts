<s>The <b title='corridor'>Hallway</b>, Chandler and Monica are returning from their honeymoon.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know that...I love you. And I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're really <b title='If you stick with sth, you do not change to sth else.'>sticking with</b> the shell necklace huh? (Points to necklace of shells he's wearing.)<br>
(Joey and Phoebe burst <b title='forward/out'>forth</b> from his apartment.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! You're back! (Hugs and kisses all around.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi sweetie!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on in!<br>
(They grab the luggage and drag it into Joey and Rachel's forcing Monica and Chandler to follow.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So how was the honeymoon?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this <b title='extremely good, large, or great =unbelievable'>incredible</b> couple on the flight back.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, they were really cool. And they were on their honeymoon too!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They're <b title='excellent; wonderful'>terrific</b>, and they live <b title='exactly'>right</b> here in the city.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> call.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry, we're just kind of excited <b title='because'>'cause</b> we <b title='↗eventually, ultimately'>finally</b> have a <b title='two people who are married or having a sexual or romantic relationship'>couple</b> to <b title='spend a lot of time in a particular place or with particular people'>hang out</b> with.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, were you really looking for that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, yeah. You know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>A <b title='two things or people of the same type'>couple</b>? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to Phoebe), two people?<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Greg and Jenny <b title='used to show that you think sth is very unpleasant ↗eww'>yuck</b>! (Angrily) Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what? Why don't you just give us our <b title='souvenir - sth that you buy on vacation or at a special event to remind you later of being there =memento ↗gift shop'>souvenirs</b> and get the hell out of here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We really...didn't get a chance to...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You've got to be kidding me!<br>
<i>Monica</i>We didn't get anything for anyone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That you can have.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Rachel are entering with the rest of the <b title='group of people'>gang</b> already inside.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hello!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Welcome home.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, how was the honeymoon?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It was great! It was great! But how about you?! I mean you're having a baby!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah we are, it's so exciting.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I always knew you two would... have a child out of <b title='the state of being married ↗single, matrimony, betrothed'>wedlock</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Look! I have a <b title='an image, esp of a baby that is still inside the womb, which is produced by ultrasound [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Head-3D-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Head-3D.jpg/220px-Head-3D.jpg">'>sonogram</b> picture!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh good! (Rachel shows them the picture.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross! It's got your <b title='having curves; not straight'>wavy</b> black lines!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, so <b title='because of sth / as a result of sth'>now that</b> Ross knows can you tell us you know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Monica! That's not right! Start with where.<br>
(Rachel looks at Ross and gets his approval.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're welcome <b title='used to address sb'>buddy</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glaring</b> at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And so I had a lot of work to do and Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to <b title='help out - help'>help me out</b>. <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> we had a little wine, we <b title='get to doing sth - start doing sth'>got to talking</b>, and the next thing you know <b title='happening or appearing suddenly ↗out of the blue'>out of nowhere</b> Ross <b title='come on to - behave in a way that shows sb that you want to have a sexual relationship with them ↗be all over sb, hit on, flirt'>comes on to me</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughs) Umm that's...that's a little <b title='intended or likely to make sb believe sth that is incorrect or not true'>misleading</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What is?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The lie you just told.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That-that you came on to me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>There's the one!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But you did! I mean, let's be honest.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes let's.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ross, if it helps: I don't believe you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That's right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know you kissed me first.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I was sending you signals?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>. Ok, anyone in this room think that I would actually send Ross begging symbols, please, <b title='If a question is decided by a show of hands, people vote on it by raising their hands to indicate whether they vote yes or no.'>show of hands</b>. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what people believe! What matters is what happened!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Well so these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? You know what? Rachel, just-just <b title='stop talking about it'>drop it</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No please, show me how I begged you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can show you, I have it on videotape! (<b title='very shocked or upset'>Stunned</b> silence) It's an expression.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, time has lapsed, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are in the kitchen. There's knocking coming form outside. Joey goes to investigate.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(knocking on Rachel's door) Come on Rachel, <b title='open the door'>open up</b>, let me explain.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Still won't let you in huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Listen, I'm just gonna close this door so we can talk about you.<br>
(He does so then goes and sits back down)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't believe he <b title='tape - record sth onto a tape'>taped</b> the two of them having sex!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> tell a girl before you tape her. Such a <b title='sb who has just started doing a job and has little experience ↗amateur, pro, veteran'>rookie</b> mistake.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know who has a great video camera?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Do you still wanna call <b title='them'>'em</b>? I wanna call 'em.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let's call 'em.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!<br>
(Monica goes over and dials their number.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street <b title='a store that sells food such as cooked meat, cheese etc =delicatessen'>deli</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talking to that place.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Here you are'>Here you go</b> <b title='a word used to address a young woman, or your wife, husband or lover'>babe</b>. (Shows her the number again.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It's the deli again!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! I'll have a sandwich!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(hangs up) I don't think this number's right!<br>
(Joey and Phoebe laugh.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You got fake numbered.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! People don't do that!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh I think we do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know! You were a <b title='sth that makes you feel very happy or satisfied'>delight</b> to talk to. You asked all those <b title='showing a very good understanding of a person or a complicated situation'>insightful</b>, great questions.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And you've never been funnier. I mean joke, joke, joke, I mean you were a <b title='sb who is very funny'>hoot</b>!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i><b title='excuse'>'Scuse</b> me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's <b title='reject - sb who has not been accepted as a member of a team, society etc'>rejects</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm, I wonder why. <b title='sb whose sexual behavior is considered unnatural and unacceptable'>Pervert</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, listen I am not a pervert!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's like the pervert <b title='a brief statement used to express a principle, goal, or ideal ↗mission statement'>motto</b>! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='film - make a film/movie'>Filming</b> Rachel was not something I <b title='↗mean to, on purpose, accidental, deliberate'>planned</b>. Ok look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can <b title='back up - say or show that what sb is saying is true'>back me up</b> on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago remember I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Person-? What personal thing? I don't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>About...about sex? (Joey looks at him <b title='↗puzzled, bemused, perplexed, bewildered'>confused</b>) That I hadn't had sex in months?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talking about.<br>
(Six Weeks Earlier)
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Joey is reading a <b title='a breakfast food made from grain and usu eaten with milk'>cereal</b> box as Ross enters wearing the red sweater.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you have <b title='↗a sec'>a minute</b>? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Whoa, for like months?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Five to be lying, six.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Six months? Whoa that's <b title='difficult ↗tough, tricky'>rough</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to <b title='recognize the good or special qualities of sth'>appreciate</b> the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Please help me! I have a <b title='romantic meeting with sb'>date</b> tonight. It has to go well ok-I'm scared for my health!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Ok. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. Ok, it's this story I <b title='come up with - think of'>came up with</b>, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like <b title="a soft gray substance used for putting glass in windows. be/like putty in sb's hands - be easily controlled or influenced ↗pushover, sucker">putty</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ok. <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying or changing the subject">Now</b> you're gonna wanna have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying the opposite of what you mean, or speaking in a way intended to make sb else feel stupid'>sarcastic</b>) I'll try to control myself.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was <b title='backpack - hike while carrying a backpack ↗trek, rucksack, knapsack'>backpacking</b> across Western Europe...<br>

<i>Ross</i>Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story <b title='suck - of very bad quaility'>sucks</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's 'cause you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! No, I don't...don't want to.<br>
<i>Joey</i>How long since you've seen a girl naked?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I was backpacking, across Western Europe.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm not feeling it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I was just outside Barcelona, hiking...<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No! No Ross! I'm not <b title='sexually excited ↗turn on'>hot</b>! Are you hot?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's been six months! I'm always hot!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well you're not <b title='↗buy'>selling</b> the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc ↗cast'>audition</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm not hungry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. I'll <b title='set sb up - put sb in a position in which they are able to do sth'>set you up</b> with my video camera and you can record yourself <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> watch it and see what you're doing wrong.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'll try that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, now... All right, you're <b title='completely'>all</b> set up. You<b title='be good to go - be ready to do sth'>'re good to go</b>. Just <b title='press switch ↗flip'>hit</b> record. All right? Good luck.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks. Thanks. And-and hey Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Listen, if you <b title='at any time'>ever</b> have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me <b title='used to address sb ↗dude, buddy, pal, fella'>man</b>. (Exits.)<br>

(Ross pours himself a glass of wine, hits record, and sits down in front of the camera.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? <b title='↗lenses, contact (lens)'>Lens</b> cleaner? Your battery <b title='↗dead'>ok</b>? (Rachel <b title='burst in - enter a room or building suddenly and noisily'>bursts in</b> carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.<br>
(They sit down on the couch, which is in front of the still recording camera.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(voiceover) So when she came in, I got <b title='not able to concentrate on sth'>distracted</b> and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.<br>
(Pause)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on Ross, It'll be like watching the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_channel">Wiki</a>]'>discovery channel</b>, <b title='but'>only</b> we know the monkeys!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I'm not gonna let you guys watch us. I-I haven't even seen it yet.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'll trade you two tapes of me having sex.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks, <b title="I'm ok / No thanks / I'm fine, I don't need it. [<a href='http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091027113011AAnRBrW'>link</a>]">I'm good</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. Look, we don't wanna see the <b title='↗obscene, porno, lewd'>dirty</b> <b title='things'>stuff</b>, just the stuff leading up to it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, Rachel's gonna kill me <b title='already'>as it is</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you. (Joey <b title='mouth - form words with your mouth but not make any sound'>mouths</b> to Ross, "You'll show me right?") No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're right. (Mouths, "I know you'll show me, right?)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey! No!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='very clear and easy to understand'>Loud and clear</b>! (Mouths, "You'll show me," and nods.)<br>
(Ross storms out.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in the living room.</s>
<i>Monica</i>I still don't <b title='understand'>get</b> why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know, if they knew what they were doing, they probably didn't give you real names either.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, maybe people <b title='If you give out information, you make it known to people'>give out</b> fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! Although, you <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> tell <b title='a very large amount of'>an awful lot of</b> jokes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! Joke!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well maybe it was all of your questions.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What about my questions?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The <b title='used for emphasizing the amount or degree of sth ↗shrill'>sheer</b> <b title='the loudness of a sound'>volume</b>, it was like flying with the <b title='usu appears as an enemy of Batman [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddler">Wiki</a>] ↗riddle, Sphix, pyramid, Giza'>Riddler</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(angrily) Was that another question?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Oh <b title='used to tell sb to be careful =look out'>watch out</b> honey, some else is asking questions now. (she does Ross' fist thing)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like <b title='not intentional ↗accident'>an honest mistake</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles <b title='lurid - shining with an unnatural, fiery glow / wildly dramatic or sensational ↗lust'>luridly</b>) Oh <b title='used to tell sb to stop asking or talking about sth, because it is annoying you'>forget it</b>!

<i>Ross</i>Look, it was an accident! Ok? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (<b title='↗fling, flip'>Tosses</b> her the tape.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. (She <b title='set - put'>sets</b> it on the floor and is about to <b title='walk with intentionally heavy steps ↗tread, trample, stamp, plunge'>stomp</b> on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don't wanna see this do you?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used to for emphasis'>Hell</b> yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I am not gonna show you this!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Forget it, she's destroying it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to <b title='put sth to rest - stop sth'>put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest</b>! Come on now, think!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, forget it Phoebe. Ok? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I wanna see it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='↗apparently, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Clearly</b> you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it that makes me want to see it. Do you <b title='understand'>see</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(confused) Are we watching the tape or not?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't want people to see it <b title='in order to help or please you'>for your sake</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the <b title='Video Cassette Recorder'>VCR</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rachel, please...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah, a little <b title='Rachel, please... ↗trailer, demo'>preview</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine. Fine, but I want the <b title='written account, report etc'>record</b> to show that I tried to take the <b title='most positive, diplomatic, or ethical course'>high road</b>, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying...(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)<br>
(They both sit down.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>(on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Phoebe) I'm so happy!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) Oh, thank God you're here, Ross. And I need you to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh there I am.<br>

<i>Ross</i>(on tape) You didn't do it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.<br>
(Chandler is shocked and Rachel gets scared of Monica very quickly.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(taking Rachel's hand) Sweetie, sweetie, it's ok. Everybody <b title='make it - succeed in reaching a place in time'>made it</b> to the wedding. I'm fine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Kinda hurting my hand though.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this.

(<b title='mimic - copy behavior ↗ape, do, emulcate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mock, simulate'>Mimicking</b> Monica) "Ok Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel!

(She <b title='tilt - move sth so that one side is lower than the other'>tilts</b> her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh...<br>
(Rachel hits <b title='↗rewind'>fast forward</b>. Monica is completely shocked.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did you <b title='have sex'>do it</b> on our invitations?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pause) Not on the ones we sent out.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, just the ones you gave back to us and we had <b title='frame - put picture etc in frame'>framed</b>! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)<br>
(Rachel stops fast forwarding.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) Oh, can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got <b title='having agreed to marry sb ↗betrothed, propose'>engaged</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on tape) I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've <b title='go through with - do sth you have planned or agreed to do'>gone through with</b> it? You know, if we hadn't <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> caught. I mean do you think we would've done it?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) Oh yeah, sure.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ten, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?<br>
(Joey's shocked and everyone else looks at Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, get ready to see some begging!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you came on to Ross!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Now, I'm so happy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What are you talking about?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You used the Europe story!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How do you know about that story?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>How do YOU know about that story?!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her <b title='the main part of the body, not including the head, arms or legs ↗corpse, corpus'>torso</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, then I must be <b title='confused about where you are or what direction you are moving in'>disoriented</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey-hey, anyway I started working on what I'm gonna say for the ceremony, you wanna hear it?<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b>-now, listen, this is just a first <b title='a rough written version of sth that is not yet in its final form'>draft</b> so...

"We are gathered here today on this <b title='very happy; causing people to be happy'>joyous</b> occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods her approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."<br>

<i>Carol</i>Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the quarter trick with her as well.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Carol</i>What a nice surprise! What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "<b title="What's happening">What's up</b> with Carol and <b title='cute'>sweet</b>, little Ben?"<br>
<i>Carol</i>Nice. Umm- Come on in.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Carol</i>Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can chat.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'd love that. I would loooove that (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...<br>
<i>Ben</i>(jumping up from behind her chair) <b title="I've got you">Gotcha</b>!! (Rachel jumps up <b title='suddenly frightened or surprised'>startled</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you ok?<br>
<i>Carol</i>(from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes oh- (To Ben) Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben <b title="↗shake sb's head">nods no</b>.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Ok, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?<br>

<s>Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are returning from Central Perk.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is gonna happen to you! Stop being such a baby!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, interesting you <b title='used after certain expressions of sorrow, surprise etc'>should</b> call me that! <b title='because/as the result of sth'>Now that</b> I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok you guys, I got a little more written. You ready?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. O-ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I <b title='used to say that it is impossible to prevent or avoid sth'>can not help but</b> <b title='↗jealous'>envy</b> the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>How about receiving?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See Joe, <b title='used to say you are not suggesting sth'>not that</b> that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! You know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories, about us!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, like the time you and I went to <b title='a city in Atlantic County, New Jersey, a major resort city in the northeast known for its casinos, boardwalk and beach [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City">Wiki</a>]'>Atlantic City</b> and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?<br>

<i>Joey</i>I got you. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It doesn't say that!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See, Joe, we want you to tell stories but you know, romantic stories. Nice stories.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Ok. Ooh! Ooh! Uh.. Ok, maybe I talk about London! You know when you two <b title='hook up - start having a sexual relationship with sb'>hooked up</b>! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."<br>

<i>Joey</i>"...by <b title='do it - have sex ↗consummate'>doing it</b>."<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ok. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing you know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Isn't that what happened with you and the <b title='a girl or young woman who helps a bride before and during her wedding ↗maid of hornor, best man'>bridesmaid</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! I call that London style.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. No that is not what happened with us.<br>
<i>Phoebe (moves from the couch to the floor)</i>Ooh maybe you should say it is because London Style sounds nice. (Joey nods his head in agreement.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, uh... well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought that I was Ross's mom.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And uh Chandler was, was really sweet and he <b title='console - make sb feel better when they are feeling sad or disappointed ↗comfort, soothe, condolence'>consoled</b> me. And well we drank too much...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah baby!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And I was a perfect gentleman and I <b title='walked with her ↗usher, escort'>walked her</b> to her hotel room and said goodnight.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But then later that night...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah baby!<br>
[Cut to London, Chandler's hotel room. He is getting ready for bed by doing <b title='a physical exercise in which you lie flat with your face towards the floor and try to push up your body with your arms while keeping your legs and your back straight =press-up ↗sit-up'>push-ups</b>. One push-up. Just as he gets under the <b title='the sheets, blankets etc on a bed'>covers</b>, there's a knock on the door.]<br>

<i>Monica</i>Wouldn't you be?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>made out</b>! You and I are making out?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, not anymore.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But we don't do that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, I just thought it would be fun.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How drunk are you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about <b title='take advantage - make use of sb/sth in a way that is unfair or dishonest'>taking advantage</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(thinks) That's the perfect amount!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok!<br>
(They run to the bed, sit down, and start making out again.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(breaking the kiss) You know what's weird?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>This doesn't feel weird!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're a really good kisser.<br>

<i>Monica and Chandler</i>Three! (They lift up the covers and <b title='look at each other'>check each other out</b>, then come back up with silly <b title='grin - a wide smile ↗smirk'>grins</b> on their faces.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Eh, we weren't that close anyway!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Eh!<br>
(They start making out again, and it takes Joey trying to enter to stop them.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e... (Notices that the TV is turned off.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, <b title='used to address sb'>dude</b> <b title="that I walk in on you masturbating. masturbate - give sb, esp yourself, sexual pleasure by rubbing the sexual organs">I'm so sorry</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! No! No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey no-no-no-no! It's <b title='used to say that you agree with sth, that you understand it, or that it does not annoy you'>cool</b>! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bridesmaid, I just- Where are those condoms you brought?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They're in my bag over there. (Points.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler's bag by getting as far away from Chandler's bed as possible.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, could you leave me one?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(pause) For just you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No I-I-I'm fine.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, <b title='here you are'>here you go</b> <b title='used to address sb'>buddy</b>. (He <b title='toss - throw ↗fling'>tosses</b> him one.) Go <b title='crazy'>nuts</b>. (Exits.)<br>
[Cut back to Monica and Chandler telling Phoebe and Joey the story.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you <b title='be onto sth - have discovered sth new and interesting'>were onto</b> something, but it <b title='If an action or event does a particular thing, it has that result or effect.'>did nothing</b> for me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh... (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that <b title='prostitute (a woman who has sex with men for money) ↗sex worker, tramp, whore, slut'>hooker</b> up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the <b title='a description of what is going to happen to sb in the future, based on the position of the stars and planets when they were born =horoscope ↗crystal ball'>stars</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, it's totally <b title='used to say that you think a situation was certain to happen and that no one could have prevented it ↗destiny, fate, doom'>meant to be</b>. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Joey) What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who did you originally wanna hook up with?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, fine but please don't be upset! Ok? I was really <b title='very unhappy ↗distressed, dejected, oppressed'>depressed</b> ok? And really, drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted... just sex. So, when I... went to your room that night... I was actually looking... for, Joey. (Joey smiles.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah baby! (Chandler <b title='glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glares</b> at him.) No baby!

<s>Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Oh my God! You came to look for Joey? Were you ever planning on telling me this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, because I-I didn't think it was important.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bridesmaid you'd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Noo! The <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b> is it was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with!<br>
<i>Joey</i>And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv- (Shuts up on Monica's glare.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm <b title='the person or team that comes second in a race or competition [<a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=485303">champion, runner-up, and ?</a>], come in third'>runner-up</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) I'm a <b title='a clergyman (a male priest or minister in the Christian Church)'>man of the cloth</b>, but I still have feelings!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Joey) Look, there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And <b title='used to say that sth is not certain ↗perhaps, possibly, maybe'>who's to say</b> I would've even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> too <b title='sth of great importance or consequence'>big a deal</b> out of this, all right? Look, everything <b title='work out - prove effective or successful'>worked out</b> ok!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, it's just weird! Ok? I don't wanna be standing there saying my <b title='vow - a formal and serious promise'>vows</b> and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need... I don't know what I need. I need a walk.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait, Chandler come on, it's-it's not a big deal!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It is to me. You wanted to sleep with <b title='Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Wiki</a>]'>Batman</b>, and instead you had to <b title='accept sb/sth that is not completely satisfactory but is the best that is available'>settle for</b> <b title='Robin is the name of several fictional characters appearing in comic books, as a junior counterpart to DC Comics superhero Batman <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/BatmanRobin.jpg/250px-BatmanRobin.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_%28comics%29">Wiki</a>] counterpart - sb/sth that has the same job or purpose as sb/sth else in a different place ↗peer'>Robin</b>. (Walks out and slams the door.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is crazy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know! Robin is so gay!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, what were you thinking, how you could tell him that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know, I'm sorry. It just came out... I- you know (thinks) It's a side effect!
<s>Carol and Susan's, Rachel is talking with Ben.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>So now what have we agreed?<br>
<i>Ben</i>No more pranks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And-and what else?<br>
<i>Ben</i>That you and daddy were not on a break.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Very good.<br>
(There's a knock on the door and Ross enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rachel! What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Your good friend?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's her last name?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Carol... Lesbian?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What line?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-wh-what line? The line that <b title='prompt - make sb decide to do sth'>prompted</b> a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (In a college <b title='fraternity - a club at an American college or university that has only male members ↗sorority'>frat</b> boy voice) "<b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, don't you ever was your face?"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Ok? It-it's not funny!<br>
<i>Carol</i>(entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Carol</i>What's not funny?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Practical jokes.<br>
<i>Carol</i>Oh, I think they're funny.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You have a line down your face.<br>
<i>Carol</i>What? (Goes and checks.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, maybe they are not funny to you...<br>
<i>Carol</i>(yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, you know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the <b title='sb who is in charge of a school ↗headmaster, principle'>principal</b>'s office wearing nothing but a <b title='baseball glove <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/MAYS_THE_CATCH.JPG/220px-MAYS_THE_CATCH.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_glove">Wiki</a>]'>catcher's mitt</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That was you?! We heard about you in <b title='"Junior high" typically includes seventh and eighth grade [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_High#United_States">Wiki</a>]'>Junior High</b>! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be <b title='be revenged on sb - punish or hurt sb because they have made you suffer ↗avenge'>revenged</b>?!"<br>
<i>Ross</i>I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that <b title='from the time when sth happens'>once</b> I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were <b title='bond - develop or create a relationship of trust and affection with sb'>bonding</b> but I...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know <b title='used when adding sth to support an idea or argument'>anyway</b>!<br>
<i>Ben</i>(yelling from off camera) Crap!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I gotta go! (Runs out.)

<i>Chandler</i>Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I accept that. I don't care about that. I just... I don't want you to be upset.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How can I not be upset? Ok? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it <b title='turn out - prove to be, end up'>turns out</b> that she wanted you first!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky!

<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really? I can do it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'd love it if you do it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! (They hug.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But those are the words! Those exact words!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's <b title='almost - nearly, but not completely or not quite'>pretty much</b> about having and giving and sharing and receiving.

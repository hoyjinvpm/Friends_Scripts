<i>Monica</i>Oh my god! We did it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We just got married, <b title='exactly'>Right</b> there (points to the spot they got married)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Was it? Was it perfect? Is it too soon to see the video?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But you guys, can we just please take a moment? Our two best friends just got married. We are so <b title='extremely happy ↗blissful'>blessed</b>, to be able to share in this <b title='↗unbelievable'>incredible</b> joy.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That is so true. Mon, is it too late to switch from chicken to steak?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm so happy for you guys, and aw, and you were both so lucky. I mean, you-you- you both said the right names. And-and nobody was drunk. Nobody was <b title='(of people, esp men) sexually attracted to people of the same sex ↗lesbian, straight, homosexual, heterosexual'>gay</b>. On your first try. (starts to cry)
<s>The Wedding Hall, Monica and Chandler have just said "I do," and the photographer is taking the required pictures. First of Monica, Chandler, Ross and Joey.</s>
<i>Photographer</i>Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me <b title='a short period of time'>a sec</b>, change <b title='the material that is used for taking photographs or recording moving pictures ↗Kodak'>film</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Monica) Ok, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? What's going on?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica's pregnant!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Guys! I'm not pregnant.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah. (To Chandler) <b title='↗sperm, semen'>Slow swimmers</b>? (Chandler looks at him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! (Pause) I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> back. (To the photographer) You, take a lot of pictures. (Exits.)<br>

<i>Joey</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, and be careful who you hug. Ok, my father's upstairs in tears because you got blood on his dress.<br>
(Joey leaves to find clothes.)<br>
<i>Photographer</i>Well then why don't we see the bride and the <b title='↗best man, maid of honor'>groom</b> and the bridesmaids.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the <b title='a holy table in a church or temple'>altar</b>.) Hey, Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because I'm not.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant- (She sees Rachel shaking her head) It's because I am.<br>
(Flash, the photographer takes a picture of Monica and Chandler's <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b> faces.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?! What're you talking about?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, what're you talking about?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes, I...I am with child.

<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation I wanna remember?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who's the father?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't say.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't say, because he's famous.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe <b title="roll one's eyes - turn one's eyes around in different directions or in a circle, esp as an expression of disbelief, annoyance, or impatience">rolls her eyes</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>How about just the bridesmaids?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know I am the groom right? I was told it was kind of a <b title='sth of great importance or consequence'>big deal</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It is.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>For you. (Chandler leaves.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this <b title='used for emphasis'>just quite</b> <b title='until now ↗still, already'>yet</b>.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-hmm.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>James Brolin?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Begley_Jr.">Wiki</a>]'>Ed Begley Jr.</b> <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b>, I remembered he's gay. So.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='very interested'>intrigued</b>) Really?!<br>

<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh, congratulations.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Looks who's married, and just in time to I hear.<br>

<i>Monica</i>What? Ross!<br>
(Ross has just entered the room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So if you've got this all under control, I'm just <b title='going to'>gonna</b>.... (quickly exits)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>I just wanted you to know, that you've made us happier, you have given us more joy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Mom, I'm-I'm not pregnant.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So? Would you <b title='used to ask sb politely if they would like sth or would like to do sth'>care</b> to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes.<br>
(They walk onto the dance floor and Chandler slips and almost falls.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all <b title='difficult to hold, walk on etc because it is wet or greasy'>slippery</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, are you gonna be able to do this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not well.<br>
(They start dancing and Chandler starts slipping around.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.<br>
[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel at their table.]<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, we'll talk about something else then.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Who's the father?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh! Look, honey you know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I'm sorry. I'll stop.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it- Oh my God, it's Joey!<br>

[Cut to the <b title='the area just inside the door of a house or other building'>hallway</b> outside the room, Ross is going to see which table he's at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's <b title='↗baby/little sister'>older brother</b>.<br>
<i>Woman</i>Oh hi, I'm, I'm Mona, from her restaurant.<br>

[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's better, now-now bend your arms a little bit. Now look straight ahead. Ok?

<i>Mona</i>Uh no, nine. (Shows him the card again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh see, <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b> you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was <b title='giving the wrong idea or impression and making you believe sth that is not true'>misleading</b>.

<i>Chandler</i>Oh well, They've kind of locked themselves in one of <b title='↗bathroom, restroom'>the men's room</b> <b title='stall - an enclosed area ↗booth, cubicle'>stalls</b> right now. Perhaps when they get out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great. <b title='Because'>'Cause</b> if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only thing left would be radio, that's just for ugly people.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What size shoes do you wear?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, eleven, <b title='EUR 45 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_size">Wiki</a>]'>eleven and a half</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Great, 'cause my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?<br>

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is so huge.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course not, nothing is. Wow, between me and you...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>...in this day and age how <b title='stupid ↗dull'>dumb</b> do you have to be to get pregnant?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! You know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear <b title='↗condom, diaphragm, birth control'>everything</b> they're supposed to wear, and one of those <b title='semen, sperm'>little guys</b> just gets through!<br>
<i>Monica</i>How?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know! Maybe they have tools.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well I-I talked to her and uh, she's definitely gonna have this baby. You know, she said she's gonna <b title='↗look after, bring up'>raise</b> it on her own.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe. I just hope she realizes that how hard it's gonna be.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Maybe she hasn't really <b title='think through - think carefully about the possible results of sth ↗think over'>thought it through</b> that much.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she gonna handle this financially? How is she gonna <b title='keep objects moving through the air by catching them as they fall and throwing them back into the air; try to fit two or more jobs, activities etc into your life'>juggle work</b>? How I- she realizes she's not gonna have a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> again for the next like, eighteen years?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(starting to cry) I don't know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Are) you ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor <b title='knock up - make pregnant ↗conceive'>knocked up</b> Phoebe.<br>
<i>Waiter</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne">Wiki</a>]'>Champagne</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a <b title='a very small amount of a drink ↗gulp, swig, down'>sip</b>, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn't work.) Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.<br>
(Monica <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗exhale, inhale'>gasps</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh really?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes, and <b title='according to what you have heard or read ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b> he is married to <b title='used to mean sb/sth, when you do not know or say exactly which ↗this'>some</b> singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(interrupting) Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(shocked) What?! (<b title='without any expression or emotion'>deadpan</b>) Why bother?<br>
<i>Monica</i>How do you feel?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't wanna make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>When I got pregnant with the <b title='↗twin'>triplets</b>, I took that test like three times just to make sure.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! Maybe it's a false <b title='showing clear evidence that a particular substance or medical condition is present ≠negative'>positive</b>. Are you sure you <b title='pee - pass waste liquid from your body ↗poo, poop'>peed</b> on the stick right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How many ways are there to do that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm-I'm just saying, don't <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak out</b> until you're a hundred percent sure.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home. I can, I can wait <b title='=till, until'>'til</b> then. Wow, this is such a good party. How late does it go till?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, you-you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> take it now.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, this is your wedding.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no-no, we're not gonna be able to have fun until we know. Come on, do it as a present to me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Thank you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'll run out and get you one.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you guys are so great.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, wait a minute! Who's the father?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, she won't tell us.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See? This is why you <b title='a gift registry is a particular type of wish list... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_registry">Wiki</a>]'>register</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>It was the chair again! Ok? I'm not doing it!<br>
<i>Ben</i>Dad, can't you go back to your table?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-? No, ok, apparently little Molly Gilbert is enjoying her grown-up <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon">Wiki</a>]'>salmon</b> <b title='a food that has been wrapped in pastry dough and then baked in the oven'>en croute</b>. (He takes a bite out of his hot dog. the band starts up again and he starts to leave his seat, but it "farts" again) It what-look, I don't-you know what-eh-eh... (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Umm, would you like to dance?<br>
<i>Mona</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Mona</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Dr. Geller?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I wasn't farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Ok. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)<br>
<i>Mona</i>Ohhhh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.<br>
<i>Mona</i>I'd be happy to. (To Ross) You, are very sweet.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Sure!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? <b title='↗jump, leap, skip'>Hop</b> on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Keep dancing.<br>
[Cut to Chandler in the hallway practicing dancing and is doing it very well.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And the world will never know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, I told him how <b title='having a natural ability to do sth well ↗gifted'>talented</b> you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he thinks I'm just a <b title='a soap opera, often referred to simply as a soap... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera">Wiki</a>]'>soap</b> actor.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with <b title='freakish - very unusual and strange, and sometimes frightening =weird'>freakishly</b> tiny feet.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! He has no idea what kind of <b title='the number of different things that sb, esp an actor or actress, does well'>range</b> I have. (He gets an idea) Ooooh... don't move.<br>
(He leaves)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ahh... it's like he's running on tiny little <b title='peg - artificial leg, usu wooden'>pegs</b>.<br>
[Joey walks back inside just as Ross's dance is finishing.]<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no, thank you Miranda.<br>
<i>Little Girl</i>Melinda!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right. (Walks over to Mona.)<br>
<i>Mona</i>How cute was that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?<br>
(Another little girl walks over to him.)<br>
<i>Second Girl</i>Can I go next?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? Of course you can! Hop on!<br>
<i>Mona</i>Ok, but I <b title='↗eventually, finally, ultimately'>get to</b> hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am so gonna <b title='↗be very successful in sth you do; have sex with sb, esp sb you have just met'>score</b>.<br>
<i>Second Girl</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I like your <b title='a knot which is used for decoration on clothes, in hair etc'>bow</b>.<br>
[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='clink - make or cause sth to make a sharp ringing sound ↗click'>clinks</b> his glass) I'd, I'd like to propose a <b title="an occasion when people all drink together and say sb's name in order to show their admiration or good wishes">toast</b>. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying or changing the subject">Now</b>, when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take <b title='them'>'em</b> away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to <b title='lose control, have a physical/mental collapse'>break down</b> and cry.) I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories- Whoa! (He jumps back, <b title='suddenly frightened or surprised ↗stunned'>startled</b>.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many <b title='dialect - a form of a language which is spoken only in one area ↗accent'>dialects</b> and has training in <b title='a specialized technique in theatre designed to create the illusion of physical combat'>stage combat</b> and is willing to do partial <b title='the state of being naked ↗nude'>nudity</b>. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!<br>
[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]<br>
<i>Bandleader</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.<br>
<i>Ashley</i>Can we do it again?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)<br>
<i>Mona</i>So, is it my turn now?<br>
(A large little fat girl walks over.)<br>
<i>Fat Girl</i>I'm next!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh! (<b title='recoil - move quickly back'>Recoils</b> in horror.)<br>
<i>Mona</i>Uh, that's ok. You can dance with her first.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Ok. (To the girl) Ok. So what's uh, what's your name.<br>
<i>Fat Girl</i>Gert!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's, it's pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross's feet, but he pulls them <b title="if sb/sth is out of harm's way, they are in a place where they cannot be hurt or damaged">out of harm's way</b>.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What're you doing there Gert?<br>
<i>Gert</i>Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross <b title='wince - show pain briefly and suddenly in the face'>winces</b> in pain.)<br>
<i>Gert</i>Why aren't you moving your feet?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm trying. (He <b title='strain - try hard to do sth'>strains</b> to move his feet.)<br>
<i>Gert</i>Faster! You're not going fast enough!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert's shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to <b title='brush off - ignore'>brush it off</b>.)<br>
[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, did you uh, <b title='by chance'>happen to</b> <b title='see/hear'>catch</b> my toast up there?<br>
<i>Dennis Phillips</i>Oh my God, that was for my <b title='an advantage you get from a situation'>benefit</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I'd like to think there was a little something for everyone. Look, I know you're <b title='cast - choose actors'>casting</b> for this new show...<br>
<i>Dennis Phillips</i>Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And you if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.<br>
<i>Dennis Phillips</i>It's an all Chinese <b title='all the people who act in a play or film'>cast</b>. Can you be Chinese?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well I'm not proud of this, but... (He turns around and starts to <b title='try changing sth, esp in a way that damages or spoils it'>mess with</b> his <b title='eyelid - one of the two pieces of skin that cover your eye when it is closed ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_blepharoplasty">double eyelid surgery</a>] The procedure to alter the natural East Asian "single eyelid" appearance has been a subject of controversy.

[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did it turn into sand?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(sliding up behind her) No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some <b title='moving or doing things in a very awkward way'>clumsy</b> idiot.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh sweetie, you could never embarrass me. (Chandler <b title='grunt - make a short low sound in your throat and nose at the same time ↗snarl, growl'>grunts</b>.) Ok, you could easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! No matter what you do, I'm gonna go home with you, Ok? So, I wanna dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="↗don't tell me - used to say that you know or can guess what sb is going to say">Don't tell ya</b>, that's the last time I'm gonna buy shoes at the Slippery Fun Shoe Store. (They go onto the floor.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the <b title='the beat of a piece of popular music'>groove</b> and <b title='perform a cool dance step, get with the groove'>bust a move</b>.) <b title='you did it right; used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>There you go</b>.<br>
(Mr. Geller dances over.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops but quickly starts up again)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Wow, Chandler you're <b title='used for emphasis'>quite the</b> dancer.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks Mrs. Geller.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh come on. You can call me mom.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? I will.<br>

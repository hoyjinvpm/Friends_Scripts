(Joey and Ross enter. Phoebe and Mike are sitting on the couch, reading a magazine.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey you guys!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what're you doing?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh, <b title='figure out - think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figuring out</b> our wedding plans.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's funny, we were doing the same thing!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's really <b title='not sensible'>crazy</b>! The hall, the dress, the food, I-I had no idea how expensive this <b title='things'>stuff</b> was!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah it is really <b title='expensive'>pricey</b>. I mean, I <b title='freak - become angry, surprised, excited, or frightened =flip'>freaked</b> when I first heard the numbers.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So what did you two do about it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It was <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> simple actually, I <b title='come up with - think of'>came up with</b> a couple of cost-cutting solutions, <b title='write out - complete'>wrote out</b> a list and Monica told me to <b title='used when you are very angry with sb'>go to hell</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>There's no way around it Pheebs, you just <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> have to accept the fact that this is <b title='going to'>gonna</b> cost you a lot of money.<br>
<i>Mike</i>I heard the weddings... were like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. This- it's a lot of money to spend on one day.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey, I've been married before, I don't need a big wedding. All I ask is that you don't do <b title='an illegal drug that gives a feeling of happiness and energy'>ecstasy</b> and <b title='kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>make out</b> with my brother.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But really, it <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> seem like this money could be put to better use?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you could buy <b title='a lot of ↗a bunch of'>a ton of</b> <b title='an American multinational direct-selling company [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Wiki</a>]'>Amway</b> products.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, give it all to <b title='an organization which raises money in order to help people who are ill, disabled, or very poor ↗donation'>charity</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, that's great. How am I gonna <b title='sell unwanted goods'>unload</b> all those Amway products.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Are you serious?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>Now</b>, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and-and we just got married at City Hall?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I think it would make me <b title='want to'>wanna</b> marry you even more. (he kisses her)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I've <b title='got to'>gotta</b> say you guys, that's-that's an incredible <b title='sth that you do to communicate your intentions towards sb, esp good intentions'>gesture</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No no no. The next time it's gonna be <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Wiki</a>]'>Hawaii</b> at <b title='↗sunrise, dusk, dawn'>sunset</b>. (pause) But maybe the time after that!
<s>Monica and Chandler's apartment.</s>
(Monica is cleaning the table, Chandler is sitting on the sofa. Joey enters.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Our adoption social worker is <b title='come by - visit ↗come over, drop by, stop by'>coming by</b> today so we're cleaning the apartment.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean, in order to make an unkind joke or to show that you are annoyed'>sarcastically</b>) We?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And it has to <b title='happen'>go</b> perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, maybe I should <b title='make a short visit'>stop by</b>! She could be a <b title='a TV series about the imaginary lives of a group of people'>soap opera</b> fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a <b title='a famous person'>celebrity</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pointing at himself) Little people?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(pointing at himself) Celebrity.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, um, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... <b title='pornography - books, films, etc that describe or show sexual acts in order to cause sexual excitement '>porn</b> or cigarettes?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? NO!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(he stands up and he feels very <b title="offend - make sb upset and angry by doing or saying sth">offended</b>) I don't, and I'm offended by the <b title='insinuate - say sth unpleasant in an indirect way ↗imply'>insinuation</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes <b title='tape - stick sth onto a surface using tape that is sticky on one side'>taped</b> to the back of the toilet <b title='container'>tank</b>, or a <b title='very offensive, usu because of dealing with sex in an unpleasant way ↗dirty, obscene, lewd'>filthy</b> video in the <b title='Video Cassette Recorder'>VCR</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, it isn't mine!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(going out with the VCR in his hand) I guess we'll never know whose it is!
<s>The New York City Children's fund <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>.</s>
<i>Charity guy</i>May I help you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes. We're here to make a rather <b title='fairly large'>sizeable</b> <b title='sth which sb gives to a charity or other organization'>donation</b> to the children.<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it <b title='used with a verb (and a direct object) to indicate the action was performed in some impressive way'>the crap out of</b> this one (she gives him a check)<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Well, this is very generous!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And we don't want any recognition. This is completely <b title='unknown by name'>anonymous</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Completely anonymous. From two <b title='saying or doing things that show that you care about other people and want to help them or make them happy'>kind</b> strangers.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Well if you like, we can include your names in our <b title='a printed document containing information about the recent activities of an organization'>newsletter</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Not necessary.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.<br>
<i>Mike</i>And "X" is spelled uh... "Mike Hannigan". Possible <b title='the title of a newspaper report'>headline</b>: Attractive Couple Makes World Better.<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Right. Well, <b title='instead of sb, or as their representative'>on behalf of</b> the children: thank you both very much.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used as a reply when sb thanks you'>Sure</b>, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!<br>
<i>Mike</i>It does. It feels really good!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, look! And we get these free T-shirts! (she takes a T-shirt which was on the counter)<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mhm... it's <b title='slightly wet ↗humid'>moist</b>.
<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(he enters) Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! Emma will be <b title='not in bed'>up</b> in a minute!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, good!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful <b title='paleontology - the study of the history of the Earth using fossils'>paleontologists</b> out there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Absolutely.<br>
<i>Ross</i>There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, uh... what're you gonna do today?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, what?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Be-caaauuuse...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a <b title='a traumatic experience is so shocking and upsetting that it affects you for a long time'>traumatic</b>... swing incident... when I was little.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Seriously?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then <b title='suddenly'>all of a sudden</b> my hair got <b title='twisted together in an untidy mass'>tangled</b> in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big <b title='a large amount'>chunk</b> of my hair! (crying) And it was <b title='not equal or equally balanced'>uneven</b> for weeks!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sarcastic) And you <b title='make it through - to not die as a result of an illness or accident'>made it through</b> that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, fine! You can <b title='↗laugh at'>make fun of</b> me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Danes">Wiki</a>]'>Claire Danes</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I'm sorry to hear about your <b title='a very sad event that causes people to suffer or die ↗catastrophe, fiasco'>tragedy</b>, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. <b title="Listen to what I'm going to tell you">You know what</b>, you should come with us and you'll see!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're- and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Space is filled with <b title='orbit - move around a large object in space such as a planet'>orbiting</b> children. (pause) Look, please, just <b title='encourage sb to do sth; tell sb that you know that what they have just said was not true; expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, you know, when you see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Good, you know, you don't wanna be one of those mothers who <b title='pass on means the same as pass ↗help out - help'>pass on</b> their <b title='done or happening without clear or sensible reasons ↗logical, reasonable, sensible'>irrational</b> fears to their children, do you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
<s>Monica's apartment. Somebody knocks the door.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, the adoption lady is <b title='arriving or happening before the usual or expected time ≠late'>early</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, ok, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling <b title='an exaggerated sound or movement is emphasized to make people notice'>exaggeratedly</b>)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hello, is this the <b title='unpleasant in a way that makes you feel nervous or frightened'>creepy</b> <b title='a house or other place where sb lives'>residence</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). I don't know if you wanna use it, but...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Aww, this is so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> of you! Aww, but you know what? I won't be needing a <b title='a thin piece of material that women wear to cover their faces at formal occasions or for religious reasons'>veil</b>, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I told you I am not coming to a naked wedding!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, no, no, we're just- we're not having a big <b title='formal party'>reception</b>, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we <b title='give sth such as money or goods to an organization'>donate</b> it to a children's charity.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's crazy!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Generous.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Crazy geneous! (Phoebe looks <b title='confused and not certain what to do ↗puzzled, bemused, perplexed'>bewildered</b>.) I am sorry. I just- I can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, well, we're different! You know, I don't care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I just look like (she looks her <b title='reflected'>reflex</b> image on a <b title='a piece of electrical equipment used for making toast'>toaster</b>), well, <b title='obviously very happy or very beautiful ↗glow'>radiant</b>. (pause) All right, but who cares, you know I don't need a pretty veil and a <b title='expensive and fashionable'>fancy</b> dress.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right. You're making a <b title='It means sharing your life with that woman. That includes loyalty, perseverance, honesty, respect and all of the rest.

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, now, it's ok, it's ok, it's OK! I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding. (she covers her mouth)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, yay!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But you already gave all the money to charity!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I'll just ask for it back!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't think you can do that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why not?! This is her wedding day, that's <b title='very, by a large amount'>way</b> more important than some stupid kids!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.
<s>The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they're ready to play.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, ok. Be careful.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, she's got like three hairs!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I know (she touches Emma's head) but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I promise you she's safe! Ok? Now, watch, watch how much she loves this.<br>

<i>Mike</i>We're seriously asking for the money back?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's for our wedding day!

<i>Laura</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Laura</i>I just realized why I remember this place.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? What is it?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?<br>

<i>Mike</i>Well, hey, at least you're getting a <b title='of a good and generally accepted standard'>proper</b> wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.<br>
<i>Mike</i>No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, but I wanna re-give the money to the children.<br>
<i>Mike</i>But we CAN'T! I mean you called the guy a sweaty little man. Unless you were talking about me, I don't know. We never really <b title='clear up - solve a problem or a mystery'>cleared that up</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's <b title='affected or influenced by sth illegal, dishonest, or morally wrong'>tainted</b>.<br>

<s>Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.</s>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!<br>
<i>Laura</i>Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need <b title='as far as or approaching a certain point'>up to</b> here.<br>
(She starts checking her form.

(Joey enters through the side window and <b title='jog - run at a slow steady speed'>jogs</b> towards the kitchen holding a baseball bat)<br>

<i>Joey</i>Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, we're not.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But you called me Bert! That's our <b title='for secret messages'>code</b> word for danger!<br>

<i>Joey</i>We don't? We really should. <b title='from this moment and always in the future ↗as of, ever since'>From now on</b>, Bert will be our code word for danger.<br>

<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) What room should we see next?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
(Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler walks towards the living room, but then Joey enters again.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I forgot my bat.<br>
(He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes.)<br>

<i>Laura</i>I don't know. Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry-<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to <b title='get over sb - start to forget sb and feel happy again after a relationship has ended'>get over you</b>? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)<br>

<i>Laura</i>(laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>But, we're-we're giving you this!<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a <b title='an amount of money etc that you give in order to achieve sth or to help make it successful'>contribution</b>. (gives the check to Phoebe)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(looks at the amount on the check, and <b title='↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>) Well, this is very generous!<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can <b title='regularly put money in a bank or invest it so that you can use it later'>save up</b>, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you <b title='ask for sb - say that you want sb to come and speak to you'>ask for Brian</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, is that you?<br>
<i>Charity guy</i>No!
<s>Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in their living room when the phone rings.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hello? Oh hi! Oh my God! Really? I can't wait to tell Chandler. Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wrong number?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It was Laura. She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's great!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Now we just have to wait for a call and-and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Ohh.<br>
(Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again. Monica's eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello? Have you seen Joey's bat?
<s>The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there. Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(nervously) Ok...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Gasps and speaks at a higher <b title='how high/low sound is'>pitch</b>) This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='slowly and unwillingly'>reluctantly</b>) Ok. O-k...<br>
(She slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(more confident) Ok.<br>
(She slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Whoo. Ok. Oh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>See?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>A-alright! I can do this.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right; you did it right'>There you go</b>! <b title='used to show approval'>Good for you</b>! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I-I don't really even feel him in here anymore.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's 'cause he's on your neck.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of the spider) Aaah! Aaahh!<br>
(Ross is now <b title='thinking about sth a lot, with the result that you do not pay attention to other things ↗distracted'>preoccupied</b> with the spider, and forgets that Rachel is still using the swing. While trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of Rachel, who <b title='bump into - hit / knock against'>bumps into</b> him, throwing him on the ground again.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>ROSS!<br>
(Rachel tries to stop mid-<b title='a curved movement'>swing</b>, and the swing starts to turn from side to side)<br>

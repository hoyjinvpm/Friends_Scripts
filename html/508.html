<s>Monica and Rachel's, everyone has just finished <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving">Wiki</a>]'>Thanksgiving</b> dinner and are <b title='groan - make a long low sound =moan'>groaning</b> over their <b title='the condition of having eaten so much food that you cannot eat any more'>fullness</b>.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! It was so good. I think you killed us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I couldn't possibly eat another bite.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I need something sweet.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Does anyone <b title='want to'>wanna</b> watch TV?<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah, sure.<br>
(She starts pushing the power button on the <b title='remote control'>remote</b>, but it's not facing the TV so it doesn't work.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Monica your remote doesn't work.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. Aw, forget it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful <b title='autumn'>fall</b> we've been having.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's very nice.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, Joe.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> I was at the <b title='↗train station'>bus stop</b> and <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this <b title='a young woman'>chick</b>'s skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for <b title='thong - a piece of underwear or the bottom part of a bikini with a very narrow piece of cloth at the back [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panties">panties</a>]'>thongs</b>.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier. Joey is talking about the wonder that is the thong.</s>
<i>Joey</i>I mean, it's <b title='not much ... as ... - used to say that one description of sb/sth is less suitable or correct than another'>not so much an underpant as</b> it is <b title='an impressive achievement'>a feat</b> of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! I mean is it there, is it not there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you aware that you're still talking?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my <b title='the act of officially forcing sb to leave a house or piece of land ↗banish, exile'>eviction</b>? Hmm.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to <b title='think of ↗occur to'>come up with</b> anything.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worst Thanksgiving ever.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just <b title='move quickly and suddenly ↗dive, rush'>swoop</b> in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, you're not <b title='going to'>gonna</b> tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh God, no.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler <b title='bum sb out - disappoint, upset, or annoy sb'>bumming us out</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See, it's a tradition, like the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade">Macy&#039;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>] ↗march, procession'>parade</b>. If the parade decided it was <b title='↗lesbian, straight, heterosexual, homosexual, come out (of the closet)'>gay</b>, moved out, and <b title='↗dessert, run/walk out on'>abandoned</b> its entire family.<br>
(And with that, we start a series of <b title='flashback - a scene in a film, play, book etc that shows sth that happened before that point in the story'>flashbacks</b> to Thanksgiving's of years gone by.)
<s>Thanksgiving 1978. The Bing <b title='a group of people, often a family, who live together'>household</b>, Mr. and Mrs. Bing and Young Chandler are eating Thanksgiving dinner as a housekeeper serves them.</s>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i><b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b> Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the <b title='a male domestic servant'>houseboy</b> than with me.<br>
<i>The Housekeeper</i>More <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_%28bird%29">Wiki</a>]'>turkey</b> Mr. Chandler? (And he <b title='make eyes - look at sb in a way that shows you think they are sexually attractive ↗flirt, hit on'>makes eyes</b> at him.)
<s>Present Day. Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Every time you tell that story that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So are he and your dad still together?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no no. After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy. Should've heard his accent.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the <b title='the main male servant of a house'>butler</b>? Yes, mine's worse!
<s>Thanksgiving 1862.

<i>Past Life Phoebe</i>More <b title='↗gauze'>bandages</b>! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- (She is cut off by an exploding shell just outside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping out like you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says...) Oh no.
<s>Present Day. Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Ross</i>In this life, Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, this life! Oh ok no, Chandler's is worse.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, it must be so cool remembering <b title='things'>stuff</b> like that! I don't have any past life memories.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course you don't sweetie. You're <b title='completely new'>brand new</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, let's not tell this story.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh, come on!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, it's not like it sounds.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's exactly like it sounds.
<s>Thanksgiving 1992. Monica and Phoebe's, Phoebe is entering.</s>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='muffle - make a sound less loud and clear ↗mute'>muffled</b>) Hello?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(surprised) Hello?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Phoebe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey? What's going on?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know! It's <b title='impossible or unable to move from a particular position'>stuck</b>!!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='walk somewhere with sb, esp in order to make sure that they are safe or to be polite'>walks</b> him to the kitchen) <b title='this job, etc should be done slowly and carefully'>Easy</b>, <b title='↗stair, staircase, banister, landing, escalator, handrail'>step</b>. How did it get on?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I put it on to scare Chandler!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak out</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well then help me get it off! <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b>, it smells really bad in here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course it smells bad. You have your head up a dead animal's ass!<br>
(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a <b title='a large plate'>platter</b> and not stuck on Joey's head.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Oh! Monica. Oh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, did you get the turkey <b title='baste - pour hot fat and liquid over meat'>basted</b> - Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's Joey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What-what're you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, get that off now!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't! It-it's stuck!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, <b title='wait'>hold on</b>! Ok, let's just all think.<br>
(They all start thinking. Joey starts rubbing his chin, of course his chin is currently inside the turkey so he ends up rubbing the turkey. And I didn't <b title='do sth justice - represent sth good in a way that is as good as they deserve'>do that joke one bit of justice</b>. It's one of those you have to see it to get it jokes.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I got <b title='an idea'>it</b>. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts <b title='giggle - laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way: "split whose legs as wide as she can?"'>giggling</b>.) Joey? <b title='↗timing, inappropriate, joke'>Now is not the time!</b><br>
<i>Joey</i>Sorry! Right. Sorry.<br>
(They get into position to pull the turkey off.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, count to three. 1. 2. 3!<br>
(They both pull but Joey slips out and starts to fall backwards just as Chandler enters, scaring him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to <b title='say unkind or insulting things to ↗tease, mock, make fun of, laugh at'>taunt</b> him, but Chandler is in the <b title='the space where a door opens into a room or building'>doorway</b> and Joey is facing the kitchen.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm over here <b title='A patronizing title. patronize - talk to sb in a way which seems friendly but shows that you think they are not as intelligent or do not know as much as you ↗snobbish, arrogant, patronize, condescend'>big guy</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! Hey! Ha-ha! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!
<s>Present Day. Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(laughing) You <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> look like an idiot.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "<b title='squash - one of a group of large vegetables with solid flesh and hard skins, such as pumpkins [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash">Wiki</a>]'>Butternut squash</b>?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah that's the same.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh wait! That can't be the one that Rachel is talking about, 'cause she didn't even know that happened.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh right.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So what's-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What was it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Which one?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting <b title='very unhappy ↗dejected'>depressed</b> is what Thanksgiving is all about. You know, for me anyway. And of course, the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">Indigenous peoples of the Americas</a>]'>Indians</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, umm, <b title='used to emphasize that your statement is true of one particular person'>of all people</b>, you do not want me to tell this story!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What is that supposed to mean?
<s>Thanksgiving 1987. The Geller household, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner. The doorbell rings.</s>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Monica! I think Rachel's here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like <a href="214.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/214.html">214</a>. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Big Nosed Rachel</i>Not for me. Chip and I <b title='↗dump, ask out, go out, move in'>broke up</b>!<br>

<i>Fat Monica</i>Hi, I'm Ross's <b title='↗big/older brother'>little sister</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(seeing her) Ok.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're <b title='↗starving'>hungry</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Uhh. Oh I'm so glad you brought him here then.<br>
<i>Fat Monica</i>Hey Chandler, umm, if you want, I can make you some <b title='a type of pasta in the shape of small tubes [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Mac&cheese-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Mac%26cheese.jpg/220px-Mac%26cheese.jpg"> ↗pasta, spaghetti, lasagna, ravioli, pastry'>macaroni</b> and cheese for dinner.<br>

<i>Fat Monica</i>Damm it! (Runs off.)<br>
(Ross points out Rachel to Chandler and goes over to talk to her. Rachel is checking out her nose in her <b title='a small flat container for face powder, with a mirror inside ↗CD - Compact Disc'>compact</b> mirror.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? You know since I've been away at college.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So that's Rachel, uh? The girl you've been writing all those songs about?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You might wanna re-think the <b title='the words of a song'>lyrics</b> to, She Feels Weird Since I've Been Gone.<br>
(Rachel wanders into the kitchen where Monica is making Chandler's dinner.)<br>
<i>Big Nosed Rachel</i>Ugh! I cannot believe Chip <b title='dump - end relationship'>dumped</b> me for that <b title='a very offensive word for a woman who has sex with a lot of different people ↗whore, hooker, tramp, prostitute'>slut</b> Nancy Branson.

<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a <b title='professional cook'>chef</b>.<br>
<i>Fat Monica</i>Ok!<br>

<i>Fat Monica</i>Oh that is so great!<br>
<i>Big Nosed Rachel</i>I know!<br>
<i>Fat Monica</i>Oh <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>, listen, if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.<br>
<i>Big Nosed Rachel</i>Oh totally, totally. You know <b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>it's not that big a deal</b>, we already kinda did it once you know.<br>
<i>Fat Monica</i>I know, but you know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!<br>
<i>Big Nosed Rachel</i>I know, honey. Oh, and Chip promised, that-that this time it will <b title='the average sexual encounter is 3 to 7 minutes [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080716205856AAYh862">link</a>]'>last</b> at least for an entire song!<br>
[Cut to the kitchen, Ross and Chandler are doing the dishes.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. You know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I may be out with her all night.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, don't do that to me!<br>
(Monica enters behind them.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.<br>
(Monica suddenly gets very happy.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, it's not that, I just don't wanna be stuck here all night with your fat sister.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
(Upon hearing this, Monica starts to <b title='become upset, have a physical or mental collapse'>break down</b> and storms out. Only to be stopped by her parents.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room in the <b title='↗refrigerator, freezer'>fridge</b>.<br>
<i>Fat Monica</i>No. No, thank you!<br>

<s>Monica and Rachel's, back to the present day.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe it'd <b title='make sb remember sth ↗ring a bell'>jog your memory</b> if you guys play a little bit of Emotional Knapsack.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am so sorry. I really am. But, come on, I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a <b title='a British musical duo formed by George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s.

<i>Chandler</i>I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Actually, You know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes it was!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, it wasn't. It was actually...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(interrupting her) Ok, you now what, Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, but we wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine, all right, mine had a <b title='an imaginary creature that looks like a small man [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_%28Germanic_mythology%29">Wiki</a>]'>dwarf</b> that got broke in half, but you know, <b title='used to say that you do not care what is chosen'>whatever</b>.

<i>Rachel</i>No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)<br>
(She opens the door to reveal Chandler and Ross. Unfortunately, they seem to have their holidays mixed up. They think it's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Wiki</a>]'>Halloween</b> and they're going as Crockett and Tubbs from that legendary TV show of the late 80's, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Nbc_miami_vice_02-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/Nbc_miami_vice_02.jpg/220px-Nbc_miami_vice_02.jpg">'>Miami Vice</b>. God, we looked silly back then!)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Hi. (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows like that of Sonny Crockett in Miami Vice.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So uh, where's Monica?<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.<br>
(Monica enters, but she forgot something. Oh, about 150 pounds. In other words, she lost weight, <b title='to a very large degree'>big time</b>!)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi, Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Dude!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Yes, yes Monica is <b title='↗slim, slender, skinny, bony, boney, chubby'>thin</b>. It's wonderful. But what we really wanna hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh mom! Ok, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty, and smart. And uh, she's-she's on the <b title='a game in which two teams throw and catch a ball using long sticks with nets at the end, and try to score goals [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse">Wiki</a>]'>lacrosse</b> team and the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf">Wiki</a>]'>golf</b> team. Can you believe it? She plays for <b title='↗bisexual, transexual, transgender'>both teams</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, uh, Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.<br>

(She <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the kitchen and Chandler watches her leave and <b title='↗adore'>admires</b> the view.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Dude!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry.<br>
(In the kitchen.)<br>

You totally <b title='get sb back - do sth to hurt or harm sb who has hurt or harmed you ↗revenge, avenge'>got him back</b> for calling you fat!

<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great.

I wanna, I want him to be like-like naked and I wanna point at him and I wanna laugh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, that we may be able to do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight just so that I can give my flower to someone like him!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b>, second of all, you're not gonna actually have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and then all our neighbors will just humiliate him!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>See? yes, then you'll definitely get him back!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you <b title='turn sb on - make sb feel sexually excited'>turns you on</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh! Ok, like this, like this <b title='a large cloth that you use to dry dishes that have been washed'>dishtowel</b>! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I get a little hot, I can just <b title='touch sth with quick light touches'>dab</b> myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and maybe <b title='move sth lightly along a surface'>run</b> it through my fingers while I talk to him.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(excited) I can do that!<br>

<p style="margin-left:1em;font-style:italic">
Many know the Shriners as "those guys who drive around in go-carts and wear funny hats." However there's much more to the organization than a fondness for toys and questionable taste in headwear. The Shriners, a part of the Indiana Jones-sounding "Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine," are a philanthropic fraternity with a "serious purpose." Their main mission is to raise money for Shriners Hospitals for children. They accomplish this through events (like the Shrine football game) and personal donations. Becoming a Shriner isn't easy. In fact, those who wish to join must first reach the rank of "Master Mason" within the Masons. The Shriners' famed hat is known as a fez. Although it might seem a strange choice of headwear, the attention-drawing fez serves as an effective symbol and helps increase public awareness of the group. For the Shriners, the pointing and giggles from lookie-loos are a small price to pay for visibility.

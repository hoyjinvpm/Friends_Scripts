<i>Ross</i>God, that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of them.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, you didn't get one.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, well tonight's the big night.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, listen, how are you <b title='going to'>gonna</b> ask her?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves, therefore <b title='she knows'>knows</b> how expensive it is. Then, when the glasses are full, instead of <b title='wish happiness, success, etc to sb/sth by drinking wine'>proposing a toast</b> I'm just <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='ask sb to marry you'>propose</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh...<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're gonna <b title='mess up - spoil/ruin ↗screw up'>mess it up</b> let me do it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not gonna mess it up.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If she says no, can I have the ring?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She's not gonna say no.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastically</b>) Sure!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, w-w-wait, what about me? I want one too.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(starting to become real upset) She's not gonna say no!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Rachel) I'll let you borrow it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
(Monica's entrance makes Phoebe try to hide the ring by putting it in her mouth.)<br>

(Monica goes into her room.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Phoebe) <b title='give me it'>Give it</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's gone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(with his mouth full) Hi Monica.<br>
(She goes into the bathroom.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for <b title='having less money and fewer possessions and opportunities than other people'>underprivileged</b> kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's the big deal?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Where are you going?<br>
(Chandler stares at him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='a bar at a reception that serves drinks whose cost has been borne (past participle of "bear") by the host'>Open bar</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I think so.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can do that for the kids.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. <b title='I will give back the money I owe you if you have a benefit (public entertainment, performance, or social event held to raise funds for a person or cause).'>Have a benefit</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, so you're already doing your part for the <b title='He is 12 years older than her'>kids</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sorry, it's just one of our last nights together before she leaves for camp- to be a <b title="an assistant at a children's camp, often a high-school or college student, who supervises a group of children or directs a particular activity, as nature study or a sport.">counselor</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you really see this as a long-term thing?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, you are 12 years older than her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='scoff - laugh at a person or idea, and talk about them in a way that shows you think they are stupid'>scoffs</b>) Well, who's counting?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, she is. She's this many. (holds up 8 fingers)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross, she is really young.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-uh- Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just, like making jokes, I had no idea. Well you know what? You guys are wrong. Oh yes, there is a <b title="the number of years sb has lived, in contrast to their mental age">chronological age</b> difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. <b title='↗plus'>Besides</b>, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one <b title='date - have a romantic relationship with'>dating</b> Elizabeth, not you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>See? <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b>, he could date her.

<i>Chandler</i>Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (<b title='behave as if sth is true when it is not'>Makes like</b> a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me!

<i>Joey</i>It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah, you have the ring?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, <b title='exactly'>right</b> here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!<br>
(Monica enters from the bedroom.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi guys.<br>

<i>Mr. Thompson</i>Nice to see you Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, hi!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah. I'm ok. I'm actually- I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If uh, that you were gonna be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, <b title='except'>other than</b> that, are you ok? Are you ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) Are you sure you're ok?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah- Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well, my nose got lonely.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Richard's date) And uh, you don't have a mustache, which is good. (She just smiles.) I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.<br>
<i>Richard's Date</i>Hi, I'm Lisa.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Oh, I'm sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica, Chandler. We used to <b title='have a romantic relationship'>date</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Richard! No one's supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, <b title='made jokes'>did it</b> again.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm just helping the kids!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How is you drinking helping the kids?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, so-so am I. (smiles)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?<br>
<i>Mr. Thompson</i>I think it was valued at 19,000.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so, bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Well, what am I gonna do, Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. Ok. (Whispering and thinking.) Ok. Ok. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! You know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I <b title='turn out - prove to be, end up'>turned out</b> fine!<br>

<i>Ross</i>You know, maybe she is too young for me. You know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to <b title='understand'>see</b> what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why don't you just <b title='consider sth carefully so that you can make a decision about it'>weigh</b> out the good <b title='things'>stuff</b> about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first started (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.<br>
<i>Monica</i>If the school finds out you're fired.<br>

<i>Monica</i>She's leaving for three months.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>For camp!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...<br>

<i>Richard</i>Uh, no! No! That's... art! If it bothers you I'd <b title='put out - make a fire etc stop burning'>put my art out</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, that's, that's ok.<br>
<i>Richard</i>So Monica, let me ask you a question. You know, <b title='↗as of, ever since, from now on'>since</b> we broke up do you ever, think about me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Oh really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah but it was 'cause I-I had an eye <b title='examination'>exam</b> and I don't like my new eye doctor.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Edward Nevski?<br>
<i>Richard</i>Yeah he's no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause) non-eye doctor way?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Ahh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because <b title='get over sb - start to forget sb and feel happy again after a relationship has ended'>getting over you</b> was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.<br>
(Richard mouths, "Wow!")
<s>Central Perk, Phoebe is reading as Rachel enters.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Of course I can! It's just <b title='practical and sensible'>good sense</b> to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Phoebe! We're both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't- Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!<br>
(At the same time.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>No we weren't!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I was not!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, this kind of <b title='rude remarks made when answering sb in authority ↗retort, talk back'>back talk</b> is not gonna <b title='(of an excuse) be accepted'>fly</b> when we're married!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pick me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! Pick me! I don't wanna end up an <b title='a woman who is not married or has not had a sexual relationship and is not now young =spinster'>old maid</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat- This is hard!<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is crazy! Hey, look, I wanna switch to Rachel!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!<br>
(Rachel gets all happy.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No wait! Just- Ok- Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any <b title='careless or unwise, without thought for what might happen or result ↗reckless, heady, whim'>rash</b> decisions, ok? Just remember my promise, if we get married, three times a week.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God, Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Rachel) I'm talking about massages.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
(She turns her head away and when she's not looking, Phoebe shakes her head and mouths, "No, I'm not." Both Joey and Ross smile, look at each other, and then stop smiling.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, you know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right, here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write, Joey on one napkin (does so) and I'm going to write Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is gonna be our backup! Ok?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok that sounds fair.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good!<br>
(Rachel mixes them up in her hands, moves them all around, and puts her hands behind her back.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Pick one.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='↗sure, no problem, not at all, my pleasure'>You're welcome</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(reading) Ross!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(reading) Joey! (Pause) We should <b title='used for emphasis'>just</b> switch.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.
<s>Richard's Apartment, Monica is looking around and notices an African mask hanging on the wall.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old <b title='↗weirdo, creep, psycho, maniac'>freak</b>!<br>
<i>Richard</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! You know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!<br>
<i>Richard</i>Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice <b title='treatment for illness or injury, or the study of this'>medicine</b>. Or a mustache.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!<br>
<i>Richard</i>I think that's fair.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Fair? Please, don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!<br>
<i>Richard</i>It's ok! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I don't kno- Umm. I don't know. Umm...<br>
<i>Richard</i>I know. (Backs away.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, I-I... I have to <b title='think'>figure</b>...some st - You know, some stuff before I can...<br>
<i>Richard</i>Yeah, I understand. <b title='↗take your time'>Take as much time as you want</b>. (Pause) Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)
<s>Richard's Apartment, time lapse. Richard is smoking as he hears a knock on the door. He quickly puts out his cigar and opens the door.</s>
<i>Richard</i>Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Where is she? I'm not scared of you! (<b title='avert - turn away'>Averts</b> his eyes and walks in.)<br>
<i>Richard</i>She's not here, and please come in.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a <b title='a small flat object that you put under a cup to protect the table'>coaster</b>? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!<br>
<i>Richard</i>Ok, she was here, but she left.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well where did she go?<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well she, said she had to <b title='If you think sth over, you consider it carefully before making a decision.'>think things over</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God, I can't believe this! You know, I thought... I thought you were a good guy.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Oh, hey, look, nothing happened.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well all right, one thing happened.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what? I can't believe this! You know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And what does she have to think about? I love her!<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well, <b title='according to the way a situation appears, although you cannot be sure ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b> I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, you know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well if it helps, it worked very well.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It was working until you <b title='show up - appear'>showed up</b>, you <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoiadendron_giganteum">giant redwood</a>]'>big tree</b>! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you <b title='blow - do a bad job on sth, fail, screw up'>blew</b> it! And this is my chance and I am not gonna blow it because <b title='if two people are meant for each other, they are very suitable as partners for each other'>we are meant for each other</b>! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (<b title='↗plunge'>Sits down heavily</b>.) I was gonna propose tonight.<br>
<i>Richard</i>You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?<br>
<i>Richard</i>No I don't have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what Richard... you are a good guy.<br>
<i>Richard</i>I know. (Pause) I hate that!<br>
(Chandler gets up and runs out, but as soon as the door closes behind him he opens it, runs back in, picks up his ring Richard is holding up for him, and runs back out.)
<s>The <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>, Chandler is running up the stairs and towards his apartment, but Joey is taking out the garbage at the same time and stops him in the hall.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Dude!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!<br>
<i>Joey</i>She's gone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>She's gone. She had a bag and she left.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What're you talking about?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='sb was all - used to report what sb said or did when telling a story'>She was all</b> crying and she-she said you guys want different things, and-and she needed time to think.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well where... Where did she go?<br>
<i>Joey</i>To her parent's, I think and she said that you shouldn't call her. But if I were you, I would.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't believe I ruined this.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I am so sorry man.<br>
(He walks <b title='dejected - unhappy, disappointed or lacking hope ↗depressed, oppressed'>dejectedly</b> into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles and Monica standing in the living room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You wanted it to be a surprise.<br>
(He turns to look at Joey who smiles <b title='sly - deceiving people in a clever way / seeming to know secrets'>slyly</b> and closes the door leaving them alone.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God.<br>
(Monica gets down on one knee.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler... <b title='during the whole of my life'>In all my life</b>... I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) <b title='about, with regard to'>As to</b>... fall in love with my best... my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! (He joins her on one knee) Ok! Ok! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a-, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought, that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes.<br>
(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as an engaged couple.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I knew you were likely to take a wife!<br>
(They hug again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(yelling through the door) Can we come it <b title='at this time'>yet</b>?! We're dying out here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We're engaged!<br>
(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what it's about!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
(They all hug again.)

<i>Donny</i>Joey, describe these things associated with the United States Congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word Congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!<br>
(Camera goes to Joey. The clock is at 20 sec. The word "<b title='the group of people who have the power to make and change laws'>Legislature</b>" appears. He looks at it blank faced and his eyes <b title='move from one place or position to another'>shift</b> between Henrietta and his screen)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh... oh uh, pass! (Next word: "<b title='a round building or hall, especially one with a dome (curved roof)'>Rotunda</b>") Pass.

<i>Donny</i>O-kay. Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)<br>

<s>Class of '91 reunion. Ross is walking angrily towards Chandler, who is talking to two other guys.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(to two guys) Nope. You must be thinking of someone else. I was never in the band.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?<br>
(Chandler looks at the other two guys, embarrassed)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You broke the pact!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross, that was 16 years ago.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I believe the foundation of our friendship was <b title='unsuitable in a way which could cause embarrassment or offence'>unfortunate</b> hair. (Ross just <b title="↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">stares</b> at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I didn't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh really?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh really?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>NO!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>ADRIENNE TURNER! (A girl behind them turns around)<br>
<i>Adrienne</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Chandler and Ross</i>Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>, and you knew how much I liked her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know what... you're talking about.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
[Flashback scene: 80's College party.] <br>
<i>Present Chandler's voice</i>Remember that big party? <b title='freshman, sophomore, ..., junior, senior'>Freshman</b> year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.<br>
(An 80's Rachel and fat Monica walk into the party room. Both with funny <b title='hairdo - a hairstyle, esp for a woman'>hairdos</b> and clothes)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe we're at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to <b title='pass liquid waste from your body'>pee</b> so <b title='=badly (to a great or serious degree)'>bad</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>This is so <b title='extremely good'>awesome</b>! College guys are so <b title='sexually attractive ↗hot, gorgeous'>cute</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, you had a boyfriend!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. But if some guy who looks like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Haim">Wiki</a>]'>Corey Haim</b> wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let him. (They <b title='notice'>spot</b> Chandler)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey look, there's Chandler, you know, that stupid friend of Ross' who said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It... You can so totally <b title='recognize difference'>tell</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I KNOW!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well let's see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it <b title='go - happen'>going</b> (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aren't you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do) .<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='excellent'>Bitching</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (<b title='roll your eyes - move your eyes around and up, esp in order to show that you are annoyed or think sth is silly'>rolls her eyes</b>) NOT. (she and Rachel <b title='laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way ↗chuckle'>giggle</b> a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.<br>
(Cut to Chandler. He's walking around looking for Ross. He sees him kissing a girl next to a <b title='a machine that you can buy things from'>vending machine</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Listen, Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.<br>
<i>Adrienne</i>Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to say that you agree with sth'>Cool</b>! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='stronger "no" ↗not really, not so much, nope, nah'>No way</b>.
<s>We cut back to the present. The reunion where Chandler and Ross are talking.</s>
<i>Ross</i>I didn't know you knew about that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The <b title='a faculty lounge in a college or university'>Common Room</b>".<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's why that song had so much power. (looks disappointed in himself) Man, I... I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look (hands him a drink), it was a long time ago.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're <b title='if two people are even, neither of them owes the other anything'>even</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling a little nervously) Hm mmhm.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We are even, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so <b title='annoyed very much'>pissed</b> at you that night that I wanted to <b title='hurt or upset sb after they have hurt or upset you'>get back at</b> you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not her!<br>
[Flashback scene: We cut back to the 80's party. Rachel and Monica are "dancing".]
<i>Rachel</i>I am sooo drunk.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, you girls having fun?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used when you send sb an announcement or tell them sth that you think they should know'>For your information</b>, <b title='an undesirable or offensive person'>ass munch</b>, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)<br>
<i>Pizza guy</i>Somebody ordered a pizza?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh that's me! (she runs to the pizza guy)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not gonna do good on my <b title='standardized test for most college admissions in the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">Wiki</a>]'>SATs</b> tomorrow.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well maybe you can go to school here next year and we can totally <b title='spend a lot of time in a particular place or with particular people'>hang out</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastic</b>) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='if you blush, your cheeks become red because you feel embarrassed or ashamed'>blushing</b>) Oh, what a <b title='a series of words'>line</b>. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers "Oh my God!")<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So where're you applying to?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of- (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She <b title='pull away - move away or backward / withdraw ↗pull over/up'>pulls away</b>) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm in college and I'm in a band.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(She considers it for a second) Yeah ok. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
<s>Monica's apartment. The stripper is sitting at the kitchen table. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe are standing around him.</s>
<i>Roy</i>What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.<br>
<i>Roy</i>No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should've hung up that <b title='designed to break, bend, or fall apart easily'>breakaway</b> <b title="a piece of men's underwear that supports their sex organs during sport">jockstrap</b> years ago. Half the time, it just pops off by itself.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh maybe now is a good time for cake and presents.<br>
<i>Roy</i>What am I gonna do? I mean, this's been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, wait. No there's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?<br>
<i>Roy</i>I don't know. I can make my <b title='the large muscles in your chest ↗abs'>pecs</b> dance. I can <b title='lift'>pick up</b> a dollar bill with my <b title='↗arse, ass, bottom, buttock, tush, tushy, tushie, posterior, rear, stern'>butt</b> cheeks. I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So maybe something in an office.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or you, you could teach stripping. You know, share your <b title='a natural ability ↗talent'>gift</b>, <b title='relinquish (give up) responsibilities, a tradition, practice, or knowledge to another ↗delegate'>pass the torch</b>.<br>
<i>Roy</i>You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>There you go</b>. Ok, do you think you're gonna be ok?<br>
<i>Roy</i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(after a pause) Finish it!<br>
<i>Roy</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your last dance. Do it for us.<br>
<i>Roy</i>Really?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Phoebe) Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.<br>
<i>Roy</i>Ok! All right! Get ready ladies!<br>

He dances around the tables in between all the girls, and gets back into the kitchen part of the room. He then tears off one of his sleeves and throws it towards Monica and Rachel, who fight over who gets it. He then tears off his other sleeve and moves it back and forth between his legs, getting closer to Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh this is so hot!<br>
(Roy then sits on Phoebe's lap, looking exhausted)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no no no, don't stop!<br>
<i>Roy</i>(out of breath) Have to.

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, it matters to me.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Seriously, where did this happen?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all-all buried in peoples' coats. Well, I-I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I <b title='↗mean to, intend to, deliberate, on puprpose'>accidentally</b> got her lips.

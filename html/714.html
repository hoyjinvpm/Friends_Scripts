<i>Ross</i>Happy birthday!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Happy birthday!<br>
(Rachel <b title='↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glares</b> at them and goes back into her room, closing her door.)<br>
<i>All</i>Rach! Come on! Rach!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's your birthday!<br>
<i>Tag</i>(entering from her room) Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Ms. Green would like to establish some <b title='basic principles'>ground rules</b> before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or <b title='get worse in quality, health, etc'>downhill</b> or (To Joey) <b title='Her breasts, butts etc'>they</b> still look pretty <b title='used for emphasis'>damn</b> good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>They do!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chocolate-<b title='bit'>chip</b> pancakes!<br>
(There is no response from Rachel as Joey blows his party noise maker.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>We've got presents!<br>
(She opens the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Good ones?<br>
<i>Monica</i>They all came from the list you <b title='↗distribute'>handed out</b> to us two weeks ago.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on, Rach! Look, turning thirty <b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>is not that big a deal</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh really? Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?<br>
[<b title='a part of a film etc that shows a scene that happened earlier in time than the main story'>Flashback</b> to Joey's thirtieth birthday party. It is being held in Monica and Chandler's apartment.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>(screaming) Why? God, Why? We had a <b title='agreement'>deal</b>! Let the others grow old! Not me! (He buries his head in Phoebe's <b title='↗shin, calf, thigh'>lap</b> for comfort.)<br>
[Cut back to Rachel's party, everyone is now eating breakfast, except Rachel.]<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.<br>
[Flashback to Chandler's thirtieth birthday party. It is also being held in Monica and his apartment. He is about to blow out the candles on his birthday cake.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>(screaming) And now Chandler! We're all getting so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)
<s>Joey and Rachel's, breakfast is finished but Rachel's still <b title='unhappy, sad ↗depressed, dejected, distressed, oppressed'>down</b>.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Rach, you're in a great place in your life. I mean come on, you've an amazing job, good friends...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, your <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b> is a <b title='a serial drama, on television or radio, that features related story lines dealing with the lives of multiple characters [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera">Wiki</a>]'>soap opera</b> star.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Your <b title='↗role, part'>character</b>'s in a <b title='a state of unconsciousness from which a person cannot be woken ↗pass out'>coma</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I promised myself I wasn't <b title='going to'>gonna</b> cry at this one.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, you know I know my life's going <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.<br>
[Flashback to the Street in front of Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Ross and Joey are holding a yellow tape across the road and everyone is cheering Phoebe as she bounces around the corner on a <b title='a hop ball [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_hopper">Wiki</a>]'>hippity hop</b>.]<br>
<i>All</i>Come on! You can do it baby! Come on!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='you go there, go ahead'>There you go</b>!<br>
(She crosses the line and they all cheer again.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I did it! One mile on a hippity hop! That's it! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to <b title='If you patch up a quarrel or relationship, you try to be friendly again and not to quarrel any more.'>patch things up</b> with my sister. Oh well, but yay! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a <b title='sth that you are very grateful for because it helps you in a difficult situation'>godsend</b> if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look <b title='very interested'>intrigued</b> and as they all <b title='go in particular direction'>head</b> into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity hop that Phoebe left behind.)
<s>Joey and Rachel's, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, you remember <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b>, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Let's have some fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What do you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> do today?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing. I don't wanna do anything.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Ok? I-I have a child!<br>
[Flashback to a street, Ross is sitting in his newly purchased <b title='a sports car launched by MG Cars in May 1962 to replace the MGA. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_MGB">Wiki</a>]'>MGB</b>.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>How <b title='sexy'>hot</b> do I look in this, uh?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross, a <b title='↗sedian, van, SUV, MPV, pick-up, convertible'>sports car</b>? Wouldn't it've been cheaper to just <b title='fill sth until it is full'>stuff</b> a sock down <b title='genitals - the outer sex organs ↗codpiece, <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_009.jpg/255px-Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_009.jpg">'>there</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's not what this is about, ok? I-I am a sports car <b title='sb who is very interested in sth and spends a lot of time doing it ↗maniac, nerd, geek'>enthusiast</b>. I have always <b title='be into - like and be interested in'>been into</b> cars.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, what's the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower">Wiki</a>] ↗Watt'>horsepower</b> on this thing?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='very excited and happy'>giddy</b>) I don't know, but-but look how shiny!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe you bought this.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, well get in line <b title='used as a familiar term of address for a young woman or girl'>missy</b>. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride <b title='sexually attractive man ↗stallion'>stud</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh. Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.<br>
(He starts the car and surprisingly it fires right up and comes to a nice <b title='if an engine idles, it runs slowly and does not produce any movement'>idle</b>. (Both can be <b title='rarity - sth rare'>rarities with</b> British sports cars with their lovely Lucas <b title='a system for igniting a fuel-air mixture'>ignition systems</b>, which tend not to work especially in the rain.) Anyway, this being New York he is <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_parking">Wiki</a>] ↗double parking'>parallel parked</b> on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his <b title='a long thin bar of metal or plastic attached to the front or back of a vehicle, designed to protect it if it hits anything'>bumper</b>, <b title='similarly'>likewise</b> with the car behind him. He's completely boxed in and can't move more than two inches. He tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars <b title='without getting the effect you wanted or intended'>to no avail</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Damn it! (Shuts the car off.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(getting out) Ok, who's next?
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is pouring Rachel some coffee.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what? I am gonna do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something <b title='pierce - make a small hole in sth, or to go through sth, with a sharp object ↗ring, tattoo'>pierced</b>. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?! <b title='Because'>'Cause</b> you know that hurts.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So what?! You know what? The way I <b title='understand'>see</b> it- (Phoebe <b title='pinch - squeeze between the thumb and a finger'>pinches</b> the back of her head) Ow! <b title='an insulting word for sb you are angry with'>Son of a bitch</b>!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked out</b> about turning 25.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right Rach, <b title='used when you are giving sb information, to say that you are not sure how useful it is'>for what it's worth</b>, I think that you're doing great. I mean, you know let's face it, no one handles this well.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='esp not sb/sth'>Least of all</b> you.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Why? What'd you do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Weren't you asked to leave <b title='used for talking to a boy or young man you do not know very well, often in a threatening way'>sonny</b>?<br>
[Flashback to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler has a bunch of people over in formal wear to give Monica a surprise birthday party. Joey is coming out of the bathroom and removing his tie.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here <b title='very soon'>any minute</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='feeling annoyed and impatient because you cannot do or achieve what you want'>frustrated</b>) Ok, for the last time. <b title="Adam's apple - the lump at the front of the throat that sticks out, particularly in men, and moves up and down when you swallow">It's not named for each individual man</b>.<br>
(Joey walks away and Mr. and Mrs. Geller walk up. Mr. Geller is wearing this <b title='very old'>ancient</b> <b title='a fabric woven from silk, cotton or nylon, with a thick soft surface made of a mass of threads'>velvet</b> <b title='a type of jacket that men wear on very formal occasions ↗dinner jacket, tux'>tuxedo</b>.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(To Chandler) You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller's shoulder.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>It's older than that. Ross was actually <b title='when a woman conceives a child, she becomes pregnant'>conceived</b> right near this tuxedo.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! Ok! Everybody <b title='↗duck'>down</b>! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone <b title='crouch - move your body close to the ground by bending your knees and leaning forward slightly ↗squat'>crouches</b>. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise <b title='erupt - break out suddenly and violently'>erupts</b> from the <b title='a group of people'>assemblage</b>.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i><b title='shit, shoot'>Crap</b>.<br>
(We hear some <b title='fumble - use your hands in an an awkward way when you are doing sth or looking for sth'>fumbling</b> at the door, then silence.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(getting up to investigate) Ok, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.<br>
(He goes out into the <b title='corridor'>hall</b> and finds a very drunk Monica lying up against Joey and Rachel's door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Heyyy! You got the door open! (<b title='giggle - laugh in a silly way because you are amused, embarrassed or nervous'>Giggles</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey-hey are you drunk?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nooo! (Giggles) Ok. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joey's doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She <b title='manage to - succeed in doing sth'>manages to</b> <b title='take and hold'>catch</b> herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Ok. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So, the <b title='bus boy - sb whose job is to set or clear tables in a restaurant'>bus boys</b> took me out for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna <b title='vomit, throw up ↗retch, gag, nauseous'>puke</b> on you later!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, here is the thing. We have <b title='throw - organize a party'>thrown</b> a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Noo!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Noo!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they <b title='have information'>know of</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?! You promise?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'll <b title='deal with'>take care of</b> it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(laughing) Ok we have to do something about your breath.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's still yours. Ok, <b title='used to give a slight emphasis to a request or command'>now</b> remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. Ready?<br>
(Chandler opens the door and Monica sneaks up on it. They go inside.)<br>
<i>All</i>Surprise!<br>
(Monica screams and they all stare at her.)
<s>Ross's birthday, Joey is now trying to get his car out while Ross is directing him.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, forward. Forward- Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Ok, back- Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.) Ok, forward- Stop! Stop! Stop!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, just forget about it. The guys got you totally <b title='wedge - fix sth tightly or in a small space'>wedged</b> in.<br>
(A beautiful woman approaches.)<br>
<i>Woman</i>(To Joey) Is this yours?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, actually...<br>
<i>Ross</i>No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine. (The woman walks away.)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, you soo need this car.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(running up) Ok. Ok, here's what we're gonna do. Ok, I'm gonna break into this mini-<b title='a vehicle used for carrying goods or several people'>van</b> and put it in <b title='the position of the gears of a vehicle in which no power is carried from the engine to the wheels ↗PRND [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission">Automatic transmission</a>]'>neutral</b>. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of the spot. Ok? All right, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm <b title='If an alarm bell goes off, it makes a sudden loud noise'>goes off</b>.) <b title='move quickly, hurry'>Haul ass</b>! (Runs off.)<br>
(The rest of the gang runs away, except for Ross who's trapped inside his car. To hide he puts the <b title='car roof ↗convertible'>top</b> up as Monica, Rachel, and Joey come running past.)
<s>Phoebe's birthday, she's taking the hippity hop to Ursula's apartment as a gift. She knocks on the door and Ursula answers it.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity hop.) It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Right, why do you keep saying that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because it's our thirtieth birthday.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yeah, no, we're not thirty. We're 31. Ok. (She closes the door.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Oh, it's you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. What?!<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Nah-uh!<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yeah-huh! That's what <b title='say - give information in the form of written words etc'>says</b> on my birth certificate.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You have your birth certificate?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yeah, I got a big box of family <b title='things'>stuff</b> when my mom died.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Our mom.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>(sarcastic) Right! Ok. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Do you have my birth certificate?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>No, I sold it to a Swedish <b title='sb has left their home or escaped from somewhere'>runaway</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just lost a whole year of my life.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>(sarcastic) Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Your middle name is Pamela?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yes! Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's my first name.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Right, ok, then no.

<s>Monica's birthday, it's just after the surprise.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok look at that we <b title='make it - succeed in a particular activity'>made it</b> all the way across the room. You're doing great.<br>
(Phoebe approaches as they almost get to their room.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica's a little drunk.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yay! I love drunk Monica. Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, all right, all right. Here's what we'll do: I'll get twice as drunk as Monica, and no one is even gonna notice her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Drunk Phoebe is mean.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you <b title='be careful not to hurt or offend people by what you say'>watch your tongue</b> with me!<br>
<i>Ross, Rachel and Joey</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, Monica is <b title='very drunk ↗hammered, tanked, drunken'>wasted</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Maybe that will <b title='give sth a more interesting appearance, taste, or other quality'>liven up</b> this party.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, will you just go help her get changed please?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, but taking care of a drunk naked woman seems like a job for Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yep. (Starts for Monica's room, but Chandler stops him.)
<s>Rachel's birthday, everyone is presenting their presents to Rachel.</s>
<i>Tag</i>(handing his to her) This one's from me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahh!<br>
<i>Tag</i>It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(opening it) A <b title="a child's vehicle consisting of a board with two small wheels and an upright handle">scooter</b>! (She's not happy.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Tag) <b title='keep, do not change'>Stick to</b> the list. Always stick to the list.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, open ours next. Open ours next!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Now you're a <b title='two people who are married or having a sexual or romantic relationship'>couple</b>, we don't get two presents from you guys?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Ok, read the card! Read the card!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday grandma! It's better to be <b title='old than dead'>over the hill (starting to cry) than buried under it</b>. (<b title='break down - have a physical or mental collapse'>Breaks down</b> as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That's funny, yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no-no! That was the joke!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(crying) No, I know! I <b title='understand'>get</b> it! It's funny!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, because you're not a grandmother!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny. I'm just gonna go... (Runs into her room crying.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>All you had to do was buy the card!
<s>Rachel's birthday, a time lapse has occurred. Rachel is coming back into the living room carrying a notepad.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I feel fine, but I think you're <b title='bum sb out - annoy/upset sb'>bumming out</b> the rest of the kids.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? (<b title='glance - look somewhere quickly and then look away'>Glances</b> over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! You know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35. Right? excuse me, five years.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(thinking it's a good idea) Oh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity hop.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives <b title='an Italian fashion label specializing in luxury goods for men and women [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada">Wiki</a>]'>Prada</b> four years to start making <b title='designed or provided for women who are pregnant or who have just had a baby'>maternity</b> clothes! Oh wait, but I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> wanna be married for a year before I get pregnant...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler) <b title='Look as much as you want, it still is happening'>Look all you want, it's happening</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years- Oh, wait a minute <b title='however'>though</b>. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for like a year, a year and a half before we get <b title='having agreed to marry'>engaged</b>... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Which is fine! Because you just turned- (Removes two candles from the cake) twenty-eight!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy that I'm gonna marry!<br>
(We hear Tag scream out in the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b> and jump into view of the open door on the scooter. He gives a <b title='friendly and enthusiastic'>hearty</b> thumbs up to the group and rides off, with Joey following breathlessly behind.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Will you quit <b title='hog - take or use a lot of sth in a way that prevents other people from having it'>hogging</b> it!

<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just <b title='If you get through a task or an amount of work, esp when it is difficult, you complete it.'>get through</b> a little bit more, ok? Then we can put you in bed, ok? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='clink - make or cause to make a light, sharp ringing sound'>clinking</b> two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't you see? Everybody's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my <b title='a piece of clothing that you wear on the upper part of your body'>top</b> yet!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Speech! Come on Monica!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on!<br>
<i>All</i>Come on! Speech!<br>
(Monica stands up and <b title='wobble - move from side to side in an unsteady way ↗stagger, stammer, stumble, mumble'>wobbles</b> slightly and Chandler runs over to catch her.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>(filming this) Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh-ho, I think it's nice.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think it's necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My <b title='a group of people who are related to each other'>family</b> and my friends...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(screaming) Wooo! Hoo!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I really like to say that I'm-um... (Pause) You know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is <b title='very drunk'>hammered</b>! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dad's hands.) And guess what, I've been drunk <b title='at an earlier time ↗then'>before</b>! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of <b title='a chocolate cake [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Dong">Wiki</a>]'>Ding Dongs</b> hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all ok. It's ok, because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown-up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Joey) Ok quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
(Ross <b title='pan - move (camera) in particular direction and follows the thing that is being filmed'>pans</b> the camera over to Phoebe.)
<s>Phoebe's birthday, she's telling everyone what she found out at Ursula's while sitting in Central Perk.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, Pheebs, It'll be ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b>, it totally ruined my schedule! I... I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do <b title='before or not later than a particular time'>by</b> the time I was 31!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Like ok I-I-I, I haven't met any <b title='the language spoken in Portugal, Brazil, Angola, and Mozambique [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">Wiki</a>]'>Portuguese</b> people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to <b title='sniper - sb who shoots at people from a hidden place'>sniper</b> school!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, you know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I just feel like being <b title='alone'>by myself</b> for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you know what, you guys? I think I'm gonna go <b title='walk somewhere with sb ↗escort, walk a dog'>walk</b> her home. (Gets up and runs out.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>He's gonna eat the cake!<br>
[Cut outside, Joey is catching up with Phoebe.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pheebs! <b title='Wait'>Wait up</b>! (She stops.) Listen, uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that's one thing you can <b title='draw a line through one or more things on a list because you have dealt with them or they are not needed any more ↗strike, underline, tick, check'>cross off</b> your list.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah.<br>
(Joey starts to walk away, but stops.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
<s>Ross's birthday, his car is still trapped in its spot. Now Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are at the front of the car with Monica, Rachel, and Chandler at the rear of the car.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, is everybody <b title='feeling certain that you know or understand sth'>clear</b>? We're going to pick it up... and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, ok? We're gonna lift the car... and slide it out. Lift and slide!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, I really don't think...<br>
<i>Ross</i>(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, come on <b title='dog - a friend =man, dude'>dogs</b>! Let's lift this <b title='sb that got screwed (in trouble or in a bad situation)'>sucker</b>! Oh, unless you're scared, little <b title='weakling - sb who is not physically strong ↗wuss'>weaklings</b>... scared.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Good teamwork! Ok, here we go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right everyone, lift! (They try to lift the car, of course it doesn't raise up) And slide! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
<s>Rachel's birthday, she is coming into the hallway where Joey and Tag are playing with the scooter.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey Joey...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b> Rach! My turn just started!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Ok. Hey, can I ride this outside?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Whatever! Ok, I'm not your mother.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok! (Runs off downstairs.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Not in the street!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Tag) Hi.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Tag</i>How're you doing? Are you feeling any better?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I'm doing ok. I'm um... let's talk.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Ok. (They sit on the step.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Umm...<br>
<i>Tag</i><b title="what's up - 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">'S up</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh Tag, umm... you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I-<br>
<i>Tag</i>Wait! I think I see where you're <b title='go - say sth'>going</b>, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing? (Kisses her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to, uhh, but, I just think I'm past the point where I can, you know, just have fun.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you, you're 25!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Twenty-four actually.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God! You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishing for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Me too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, Sorry. (They hug.)<br>
[Time lapse, Rachel is entering her apartment after breaking up with Tag.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! How'd it <b title='happen/develop'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You did the right thing.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering, <b title='limp - walk slowly or with difficulty because one leg is injured ↗lame, limb'>limping</b>, and holding his arm) I don't like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, here we are, just <b title='a (usu large) number of'>a bunch of</b> thirty-year-olds.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(crying) Why, God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Ross's shoulder.)
<s>Ross's birthday, night has fallen and Joey and Ross are walking by where his car is parked to find that both cars blocking him in have left.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Yes! My baby's finally free!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let's go!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(starting it) Woohoo!<br>
(Just as they are about to <b title='drive away ↗pull in/out/over/up'>pull away</b>, a big, fat, <b title='with little or no hair on your head'>bald</b> guy pulls up in the exact same car as Ross and stops next to him.)<br>
<i>The Man In The Sportscar</i>How hot are we? (He drives off.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You wanna buy a car?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
(Ross shuts it off and they get out.)<br>

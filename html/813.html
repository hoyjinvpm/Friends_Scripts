<i>Monica</i>I just had the most amazing bath.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? I don't like baths.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait, you like them with me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, baths are so relaxing!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Just come back.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Uhm, you and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Do you know what you mean'>Do you</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>In London?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>The bath salts! They're starting to <b title='release bubbles of gas ↗soda, evaporate'>effervesce</b>! It's different. (Pause) It's interesting.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, uh, let's talk about something else.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I had the exact same conversation.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You did? What was he talking about?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in <b title='written by William Shakespeare... Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth">Wiki</a>]'>Macbeth</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That was a long night.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, let's <b title='separate this into smaller parts in order to make it easier to understand'>break this down</b>. What exactly did he say to you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, he was talking about rules.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Umm, and looking at people differently.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He didn't say anything about that to me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What did he tell you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But what did he mean by rules?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute! He stopped talking <b title='at the exact or first moment when'>the minute</b> Phoebe came in!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because he was looking at her differently.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>My God! He wants to <b title='have sex'>do it</b> with Phoebe in London!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(from outside the bathroom) You guys?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Just a minute! (To Chandler) That's Mrs. Tribbiani!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You don't say anything.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest <b title='a romantic sexual relationship'>love affair</b> of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not gonna let you say anything.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, you just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, God!<br>
(Monica runs out to Phoebe, who is in the kitchen)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you had that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I thought I lost it. I-I got a new one, like, a month ago.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='(of sth) fortunate that it happened in the way it did'>just as well</b>, I broke this one.<br>
(Monica starts smiling)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's a <b title='sth that is very exciting'>humdinger</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Somebody likes you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='groan - make a long low sound because you are in pain, upset or unhappy =moan'>Groans</b>) Is it Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, then tell him to stop staring!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's Joey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?! Joey?! <b title='to express surprise'>You don't say</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is it something you'd be interested in?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, <b title='Mother of God'>Mother</b> may I? But you know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't wanna risk what we have.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess that <b title='make sense - be sensible/reasonable ↗logical'>makes sense</b>. So, you think you're gonna talk to him?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am <b title='good, performing well'>on fire</b>! First Chandler, now Joey!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never gonna have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh I don't think so! You're, you're just giving me Ruth so, so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll <b title='arrive suddenly and do sth'>swoop in</b> and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I would-Sequoia?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Veto.<br>

<i>Joey</i>I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than, than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel <b title='used to express annoyance or impatience'>for God sakes</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>For God sakes, it's Rachel!<br>

<i>Joey</i>What am I gonna do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, you know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You, you wanna hear it?<br>

<i>Joey</i>You-you think?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Absolutely! You know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.<br>

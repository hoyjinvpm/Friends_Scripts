<i>Phoebe</i>Would you say your pesto is the best-o?<br>
<i>Tim</i>I...I-I don't know, but I-I would say it's pretty good-o. (Phoebe laughs too hard.)<br>
(Monica goes over and grabs the pesto.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.<br>
<i>Tim</i>I like your necklace.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I made it myself.<br>
<i>Tim</i>You are so <b title='having a natural ability to do sth well ↗gifted'>talented</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it's no pesto.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Did that guy just call you Toby?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, he thinks that's my name.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, why don't you correct him?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh it's been going on <b title='by a great distance / to a great degree'>way</b> too long now. You know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>, so I didn't say anything. <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> the next time he said, "Hey Toby, you wanna a donut?" I-I wanted the donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Five years?! Chandler, you have to tell him!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! That would be so awkward! Look, <b title='↗plus'>besides</b>, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor you know? So he calls me Toby <b title='sometimes, occasionally, not often ↗(every) now and then, from time to time, at times'>once in a while</b>. <b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>What's the big deal</b>? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughs) Muriel. Why-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Shh! It is a <b title='↗first/last/given name'>family name</b>!<br>

<i>Joey's Co-Star</i>Drake, I've discovered the reason for your headaches and memory loss.<br>

<i>Joey's Co-Star</i><b title='according to the way sth appears ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>Apparently</b> your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.<br>

<i>Dr. Drake Ramoray</i>Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.<br>
<i>Joey's Co-Star</i>We would, but when we went to <b title='remove a dead body from where it is buried =dig up ↗excavate, inhume'>exhume</b> Jessica's body, it was gone.<br>
(Dramatic music plays and Joey does a little 'Smell-the-fart' acting.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry, what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's like, you got so many <b title='the words that an actor or actress speaks when performing in a film, play etc'>lines</b> to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all <b title='serious'>intense</b>, you know, like this.}<br>
<i>Director</i>Very nice, people!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Rachel) Ok, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm not telling you, you'll have to see it on TV!<br>

<i>Monica</i>(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.<br>

<i>Ross</i>I just...I have to find out how it <b title='go - happen'>went</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>This guy could be my baby's stepfather!<br>
<i>Joey</i>They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wh-what'd you mean?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's just I always thought when I had another kid it'd be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to <b title='drop off - take sb to place, esp in a car ↗pick up'>drop him off</b> at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this <b title='mental image'>picture</b> of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and <b title='leap - jump ↗hop, skip'>leaps</b> up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. You know? Maybe fight over the science section.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. <b title='used to introduce sth which strengthens or changes the meaning of the statement you have just made, but only in a small or unimportant way ↗anyway'>If anything</b> that picture keeps moving further away.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It used to be. Now-now she doesn't really have a face. <b title='extremely attractive (very hot)'>Smoking</b> body though.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to show approval ↗good for you, way to go'>Good call</b>. Yeah. But, the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, well I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again but-<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, Ross maybe you need a new picture. Ok? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what, there's gonna be a <b title='completely new'>brand-new</b> little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, <b title='used to make a suggestion'>I tell you what</b>. Let's- you and me go out, have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.<br>

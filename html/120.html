(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe she never got your message.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You don't think that makes me seem a little...<br>

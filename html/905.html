<i>Phoebe</i>Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thursday? But that's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Wiki</a>]'>Halloween</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So?<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, <b title='strange or frightening in a way that makes you think of ghosts'>spooky</b>, that's all.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, so, is-is Mike coming to dinner?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Ugh, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little too soon to show my true colors.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (To Ross) Which one of us should go to dinner?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Rachel! (As in "Rachel should go!")<br>
<i>Ross</i>Um, actually, I, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yay! (Less than enthusiastic.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks, I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, so great, we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What are you talking about? We're all together <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh dear God!
<s><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa">Wiki</a>]'>Tulsa</b>, a conference room.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken, is it?<br>
<i>Ken</i>That's right. Is it true that the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started by uh taking a look at last quarter's <b title='numbers'>figures</b>. (Claudia, next to Chandler, lights a cigarette.) Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to <b title='"blow smoke up the sb&#039;s ass" - compliment in a crude and obvious manner. (But you are blowing smoke up his face)'>blow smoke up the boss's ass</b>?<br>
<i>Claudia</i>I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. All right?<br>
<i>Claudia</i>Yes, in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Wiki</a>]'>Oklahoma</b> it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Would Joey like two pizzas? (Awkward silence) You don't know what I'm talking about. Alright, look, I-I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> light up, <b title='start to do sth'>go ahead</b>, it's fine. (Everyone lights up.) So you all smoke then? You know it's, it's almost <b title='↗courtesy, politeness'>rude</b>, that I'm not smoking.<br>
<i>Ken</i>Well that's not true. If you don't wanna smoke-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(loud) Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.<br>
<i>Ken</i>I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I always liked you, Ken. (Takes a <b title='cigarette'>cig</b>)

<i>Phoebe</i>(from outside) <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-or-treating">Wiki</a>]'>Trick or treat</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(opening the door) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, and treat it is. (Looks at Monica's exposed <b title="the narrow space between a woman's breasts ↗low-cut">cleavage</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hmhmm. (Closes <b title='bathrobe'>robe</b>)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my <b title='very thin and in bad condition ↗barely'>threadbare</b> robe that can't contain my breasts.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is not what I'm wearing. I'm <b title='ovulate - produce egg ↗womb, uterus, ovary'>ovulating</b> and Chandler's gonna be home <b title='very soon'>any minute</b>, so I thought we would try before dinner.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh. Ok. Oh, I thought we'd all go over together. All right, I'll just meet you there at dinner. Um, unless, I mean, if it helps, I could stay and watch.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I didn't want to, anyway. It's just, you know, just thought I'd be polite and offer. Wait! just this mean you will be late?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, see you there. Happy <b title='hump - have sex with sb ↗do it'>humping</b>! (Outside, meets Chandler.) Hey, oh hey! (<b title='↗sniffle'>Sniffs</b>) Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all common areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You smoked!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! I just happen to know a lot of <b title='unimportant details or pieces of information ↗trivial'>trivia</b> about smoking in different states. For example, in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Wiki</a>]'>Hawaii</b> cigarettes are called leihalalokos.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Sniffs him) Argh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ah, do you think Monica's gonna be able to smell it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a <b title='a large dog with a very good sense of smell, often used for hunting <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Bloodhound_800.jpg/220px-Bloodhound_800.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound">Wiki</a>]'>bloodhound</b> ... and the breasts of a great <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Freia_Gestures_to_Hyndla_by_Fr%C3%B8lich.jpg/220px-Freia_Gestures_to_Hyndla_by_Fr%C3%B8lich.jpg">'>goddess</b>... (Has odd smile.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(Enters. Talking to self) Ok, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) <b title='scent - give a particular smell to sth ↗odorless'>Unscented</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(from bedroom doorway) Welcome home. I've missed you. You wanna join me in the bedroom?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No thanks, <b title="I'm ok / No thanks / I'm fine, I don't need it. [<a href='http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091027113011AAnRBrW'>Yahoo! Answers</a>]">I'm good</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(comes over) OK, so, you wanna play it that way, do you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just got off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda <b title='disgusting'>gross</b>. Maybe I should just take a shower.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come here, you don't need a shower.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(backs away) Alright, the truth is, I <b title='soil - make dirty'>soiled</b> myself during some <b title='turbulence - sudden violent movements of air or water'>turbulences</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. (<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>) Did you smoke?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Ok, five. A pack. Two packs...a...a <b title='cardboard container'>carton</b>. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Finds a pack inhis jacket)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, those are for you.

<i>Ross</i>(On phone.) Alright, we'll just, uh, see you when you get here. Bye. (Hangs up) Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in <b title='↗traffic jam'>terrible traffic</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, what were the other two?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, see, the first one is: I don't want to. And, second one, I'm not going.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, I know, it's the first time we're leaving the baby and... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but everything is gonna be fine. I mean my mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She is?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How about Monica.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you only hear Monica's side of that ok? That little <b title='fat person'>fatso</b> was a terror.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just don't think I can do it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, you know what, you can. And you should. Really, it'll be good for you. In fact, you know, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I, will wait for my mom, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> I'll meet you there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, ah...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>A-a pigeon. No, no, wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire.

<i>Ross</i>And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I had to do.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And that's <b title="Judy Gellar, Ross's mom">Judy</b> over there at the bar with Emma?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But honey, this <b title='If an action is for the best, it is done to improve a situation or produce a good result, although it might seem unpleasant at the time'>is for the best</b>, this way I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and then I'm gonna be completely here with you and, oh, she <b title='bring a small amount of food or drink up from the stomach out through the mouth ↗vomit, throw up, nauseous'>spit up</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She spit up. Judy! She spit...Judy! <b title='act/respond quickly'>Look alive</b>, Judy! (To waiter, opening menu) Thank you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To waiter, opening menu) Thanks. Oh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='talk in a quiet voice that is difficult to hear ↗mutter, incoherent, unintelligible'>mumbling</b>) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know what you means, this is incredible.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(still mumbling to himself) Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I'll have the <b title='a soft sweet fruit with a lot of small seeds [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_fig">Wiki</a>]'>fig</b> salad and the duck.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I'll have the soup and the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Henneguya_salminicola_in_flesh_of_coho_salmon%2C_BC%2C_Canada.JPG/220px-Henneguya_salminicola_in_flesh_of_coho_salmon%2C_BC%2C_Canada.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon">Wiki</a>]'>salmon</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And remember whatever comes up first. Ok? And hurry, because-<br>
<i>Monica</i>Happy birthday!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='exclamation of negative emotion'>Son of a bitch</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Where, where have you been?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, we, had a little fight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I would never lie to get someone into bed.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You used to tell girls you were a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_family">Wiki</a>]'>Kennedy</b>. (To the waiter) Thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? Why you didn't get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. (Looks at menu) Oh, Well I suppose that Chandler will have the SMOKED duck.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I suppose that Monica will have the ... <b title='clever at controlling or deceiving people to get what you want'>manipulative</b> <b title='an unpleasant woman who always argues and disagrees with people ↗stew (a type of food consisting usu of meat or fish and vegetables cooked slowly in a small amount of liquid)'>shrew</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>How'd I miss that?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>(Leaving) I'll give you another minute.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Where're you going? (Following) He said she wanted the shrew! <br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, come on, Emma is fine. You're turning into an <b title='thinking or worrying about sth all the time'>obsessive</b> mother. Ok, you need to stop.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You guys ever hear the story about when Ross's mom went to the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_salon">Wiki</a>] ↗parlor'>beauty salon</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You mean the willie story?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh-huh, they already knew it! (Ross wins...but then realizes that perhaps it's not a good thing that they already know this story.) <br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Returning) No, no, it's ok, I already told the waiter what they want.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why would you do that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler, control your woman!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Lifts glass for a <b title="an occasion when people all drink together and say sb's name in order to show their admiration or good wishes">toast</b>) Ok, well, everybody's ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Aw... what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, Emma dropped her sock.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How'd you know that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She's over there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Mom's with her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait, Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's a good toast.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Ross) Will you please get her attention?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh-wh, mommy? Mother? (Mouths "socks" to Judy. Judy doesn't get it)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(getting up) Oh, <b title='used to show that you are angry or annoyed'>for god's sake</b>, (shouting) Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody stares) I'm sorry, was that rude? Did-did my, my little <b title='a sudden spoken expression of a strong feeling, esp anger'>outburst</b> <b title='make sth less strong'>blunt</b> the <b title='hideous - extremely ugly/bad ↗hilarious'>hideousness</b> that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do, was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the <b title='politeness ≠discourtesy'>courtesy</b> to call. (her phone rings) Well, it's too late now.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, Pheebs, I don't think that's us.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw, I feel terrible. We should've been strong and left Emma at home.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>There are some adult willy stories they don't know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We should've been stronger.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Chandler and Monica) And what is going on with you two?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you see, I'm ovulating.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating <b title='used in negative statements and questions to emphasize what you are saying'>at all</b>, maybe it's just <b title='completely'>all</b> a clever <b title='a plan or trick used for hiding your true intentions ↗deceive, excuse'>ruse</b> to get me into bed.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes <b title='-ie - another form of the suffix -y (full of sth, covered with sth, tending to sth, fond of of interested in sth)'>smokie</b>, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Joey) You're not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So? You <b title='have the opportunity'>get to</b> have sex, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(returns) Ok, that was Mike.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, honey, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh, you guys, that means the world to me. Huh, ok, I'm gonna <b title='leave'>take off</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I love you guys too, but you know, Mike <b title='get off (work) - finish work and leave the place where you work at the end of the day'>got off work</b> early. Wait. Wait, I'm not, not the kind of girl that just <b title='ditch - leave behind ↗blow off'>ditches</b> her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh thank god, if Phoebe's gone, can we please take Emma home?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, I think that's a good idea. Our babysitter just <b title='pound - do sth in a very short period of time ↗swig, gulp, gobble, down'>pounded</b> another <b title='white wine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardonnay">Wiki</a>]'>Chardonnay</b>. Bye, you guys.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Joey</i>See <b title='you'>ya</b>. Well, this is just us.<br>
<i>Monica & Chandler</i>Mhum.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you wanna give it another try?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right. So, you've never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, actually, Richard was a Kennedy on his mother's side.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why did you <b title='end relationship ↗dump'>break up</b> with that guy?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You, you gonna go <b title='have sex'>do it</b> now?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We don't have much time. Once the egg decends into <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Scheme_female_reproductive_system-en.svg/250px-Scheme_female_reproductive_system-en.svg.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube">Wiki</a>]'>the fallopian tube</b>-<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no (Not wanting to hear). Get out here.<br>
(Monica and Chandler leave, the waiter comes)<br>
<i>Waiter</i>I <b title='↗truly, truthfully'>sincerely</b> hope the rest of your party is returning.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='no'>Nah</b>, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six for one, huh. (To <b title='↗waiter, staff'>waitstaff</b>) You boys are about to see something really special.
<s>Continues, Joey finished everything.</s>
<i>Waiter</i>How was everything, sir?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Excellent. The shrew <b title='especially'>in particular</b>, was exquisite .<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Well, I hope you've got some room left.<br>
<i>Waiters</i>(With birthday cake, singing) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Joey! Joey.<br>
<i>Waiters</i>... Joey, happy birthday to you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is the best birthday ever.<br>

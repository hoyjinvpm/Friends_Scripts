<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, everyone is there and they are finishing watching the first episode of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey is of course Mac.</s>
<i>Mac</i>(on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel, Chandler, and Monica aren't amused.)<br>
<i>C.H.E.E.S.E</i><b title='I agree with you completely'>You can say that again</b> Mac.<br>
<i>Mac</i>Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.<br>
<i>C.H.E.E.S.E</i>Oh yeah? Well then <b title='why'>how come</b> I can't get my <b title='Video Cassette Recorder'>VCR</b> to stop blinking at 12:00?<br>
(They both break into a huge laugh and do that stop motion thing they had at the end of <b title='an American television drama series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHiPs">Wiki</a>]'>ChiPs</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?<br>
(They all make happy <b title="make a face - change one's expression">faces</b> as they are unable to express their feelings <b title='relating to words or using words ↗oral, colloquial'>verbally</b>. Finally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by Monica.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Hello? (Listens) <b title='Wait'>Hold on</b> please. Joey, it's your mom. (Hands him the phone.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's your mommy. It's your mommy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohhhh...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's nice.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on phone) Mom, so, what did you think? (He walks away allowing the <b title='group of people'>gang</b> a chance to <b title='think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figure out</b> what they're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> say.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well that was umm... Ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It wasn't the best.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That was one of the worst things ever. And not just on TV.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wh-what are we gonna tell him?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, the-the <b title='The lighting in a film or play is the use of different electric lights to give a particular effect'>lighting</b> was ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh no, you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!<br>
<i>Monica</i>And I have costumes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sitting <b title='exactly'>right</b> here! Whoa!"<br>
(Phoebe gets up.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What're you gonna do Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And say nothing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh, yeah that's right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my <b title='parents and family'>folks</b> really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasn't that good.
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, Phoebe and Monica are reading on the couch.</s>

<i>Phoebe</i>What? You mean <b title="if you do sth behind sb's back, you do it without them knowing">behind my back</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi, you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey! Kind of in the middle of a story here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, so anyway I'm sitting in my office and guess who walks in.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm gonna be on two TV shows!<br>
<i>Monica and Phoebe</i>Oh, that's great!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, you weren't finished?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren">Wiki</a>]'>Ralph Lauren</b>! (Monica and Phoebe <b title='breathe in suddenly'>gasp</b>) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's the same story.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='groan - make a long deep sound =moan'>groans</b> in <b title='a strong feeling of dislike, annoyance, or disapproval'>disgust</b>) Wow, it's really long.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new <b title='merchandise - try to sell goods or services using methods such as advertising =market'>merchandising</b> manager for <b title='polo shirt [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_shirt">Wiki</a>]'>polo</b> <b title='↗wholesale'>retail</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oooh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> hire my own assistant!<br>
<i>Monica and Phoebe</i>Ahhh!!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(jumps up) Well-I got a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_rush">Wiki</a>] ↗faint, dizzy'>head rush</b> from standing up to fast right there.
<s>Rachel's New Office, she's interviewing a potential new assistant, Hilda.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(reading the <b title="/'rezumei/">résumé</b>) And you were at this job for four years?<br>
<i>Hilda</i>That's right.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this ok?<br>
<i>Hilda</i><b title='↗excuse me, sorry, pardon'>What?</b><br>
<i>Rachel</i>I've never interviewed anyone <b title='at an earlier time ↗then'>before</b>. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a <b title='a female servant ↗houseboy, butler'>maid</b>, but this is-this isn't the same thing.<br>
<i>Hilda</i>No dear. It's not.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. Yeah, and I know that. So.. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.<br>
<i>Hilda</i>Thank you! Good meeting you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. (Hilda exits) I'm a total <b title='prosessional ↗layman, amateur, rookie, veteran'>pro</b>!<br>
(There's a knock on the door and a <b title='↗good-looking, gorgeous, cute'>handsome</b> man enters.)<br>
<i>Man</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.<br>
<i>Man</i>Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?! (Taking his resume) Ok, well, then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?<br>
<i>Man</i>Tag Jones.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh, go on.<br>
<i>Tag</i>That's it. That's my whole name.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's your whole name, ok of course it is! Ok, well let's-let's just have a <b title='a quick look at sth'>look-see</b> here. (Looking at his resume)<br>
<i>Tag</i>I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='encourage sb to do sth'>come on</b>, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at <b title='an American restaurant chain [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.G.I._Friday%27s">Wiki</a>]'>T.G.I. Friday's</b>, come on!<br>
<i>Tag</i>It's <b title='not good =poor'>lame</b>, I know. But I'm a <b title='↗self motivation, cliché'>goal-oriented</b> person, very eager to learn...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, just hold on a second please. (She grabs a <b title='↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid_camera">instant camera</a>]'>camera</b> out of the desk and takes his picture.) Sorry, it's for <b title='↗personnel, staff'>human resources</b>, everybody has to do it. Would you just stand up please?
<s>Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their <b title='a large, comfortable padded chair'>easy chair</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica <b title='shush - used to tell sb to be quiet'>shushes</b> him.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Monica) Anyway, I should go.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, bye.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) Hey, sweetie.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't tell you. It's a secret.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="that's so sweet">Awww</b>. (Kisses him.) But still no.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? Ok, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross <b title='freshman, sophomore, junior, senior (last year of high school/college)'>junior</b> year at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland">Wiki</a>]'>Disneyland</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh no-no, I can't do that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for <b title='a Mexican food [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-NCI_Visuals_Food_Taco-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/NCI_Visuals_Food_Taco.jpg/220px-NCI_Visuals_Food_Taco.jpg"> ↗tortilla'>tacos</b>. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a <b title='a traditional Japanese heating device [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibachi">Wiki</a>]'>hibachi</b>, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on <b title='a space-themed indoor roller coaster attraction located at all five Magic Kingdom-style Disney Parks [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Mountain">Wiki</a>]'>Space Mountain</b> and Ross starts to feel a little <b title='not very good'>iffy</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God. He <b title='throw up =vomit ↗nauseous, sick, retch, gag'>threw up</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, he visited a town a little <b title='down. north - up. ↗colon, diarrhoea (an illness in which waste from the bowels is watery and comes out often), diarrhea, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_system">digestive system</a>]'>south</b> of throw up.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Laughs <b title='hysterical - unable to control your feelings or behavior'>hysterically</b>) No!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah some of the employees decided to rename the park: "<b title='The official tagline for Disneyland is "The Happiest Place On Earth" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom">Wiki</a>] crap - shit. -y - having a feeling/quality'>The Crappiest Place on Earth</b>". So what was Phoebe's secret?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place, is getting fired.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right! You lose <b title='sb who is easily tricked or persuaded to do sth'>sucker</b>! (Pause) Please still marry me.
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, you have an assistant right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I-I just don't know how do you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it <b title='narrow down - reduce the number of things included in a range ↗boil down'>narrowed down</b> to two people. One of them has great <b title='reference - letter/person ↗recommendation'>references</b> and a lot of experience <b title='used to say what happens next'>and then</b> there's this guy...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What about him?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I love him. He's so <b title='pleasing and attractive'>pretty</b> I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that <b title='make sense - be a sensible thing to do ↗logical, sensible, reasonable'>makes a lot of sense</b> but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Let me see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, <b title='because'>'cause</b> that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? (Puts it in her pocket.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. <b title='very'>Dumb</b> old perfect for the job Hilda!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!

<i>Terry</i>Why would you think that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more like me than me right?<br>
<i>Terry</i>Everybody has to audition.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a <b title='↗cyborg, android'>robot</b>.<br>
<i>Terry</i>I'm sorry Joey that's... that's the way it is.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sitting up here in your <b title='expensive and fashionable'>fancy</b> small hall building. Making stars jump through <b title='hoop - a large ring made of wood, metal, plastic etc ↗hula hoop'>hoops</b> for <b title='you'>ya</b>, huh? Well you know what?

Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E was a great show!

<i>Phoebe</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them <b title='↗go to hell'>where they could go</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, why would you do that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Because they wanted me to audition!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You! An actor?! That's madness!

<i>Chandler</i>You know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?<br>

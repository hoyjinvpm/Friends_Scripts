<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no. No-no-no.<br>
<i>Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe</i>Shhhh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year or?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? That's like insanely easy!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗nope'>Nah</b>, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so <b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>technically</b> I didn't lose.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? You forgot fourteen states?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nobody cares about <b title='the region that combines the US states of North and South Dakota. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dakotas_%28disambiguation%29">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-North_Dakota_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/North_Dakota_in_United_States.svg/270px-North_Dakota_in_United_States.svg.png">'>the Dakotas</b>.

[Chandler's watch beeps]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, ok, <b title='if a period of time is up, it is finished'>time's up</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, I got 48.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/C%C3%A9leri.jpg/220px-C%C3%A9leri.jpg"> a vegetable with long pale green stems'>celery</b>, and I have one: regular celery.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the <b title='first position'>lead</b> in... vegetables, Joey?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Say hello to the new <b title='champion'>champ</b> of Chandler's <b title='stupid'>dumb</b> states game.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow, how many you got?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='United States comprises 50 constituent states and one district. [<a href="http://howmanyarethere.net/how-many-states-are-there-in-the-united-states-of-america/">How Many States Are There in the United States of America?</a>]'>Fifty-six</b>!

<i>Rachel</i>(counting the place settings) <b title='Why'>How come</b> we have one extra place setting?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because you invited your assistant.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I was going to, but then I <b title='thought'>figured</b>, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so <b title='false'>fake</b>, (Laughs) but I still do.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for</b> her room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Done! With time uh to <b title='have some time, money etc left in addition to what you have used or need'>spare</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oooh that may be a new world's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)<br>

You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? That's impossible.<br>
<i>Joey</i>46. Wow! Who's well-educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Ok Ross, time is up!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, jus-jus- give me another minute.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look Ross, if you don't know them <b title='at the present time ↗just/right now'>by now</b>, you will never know them, ok? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.<br>
<i>Ross</i>This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, <b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> I can get all 50 before dinner.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, but if you can't... no dinner!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used tell sb that you accept a bet or an invitation to compete against them'>You're on</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, <b title='because'>'cause</b> there's a lot on there that you don't have.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?<br>
<i>Joey</i>But the drawer full of <b title='a meal that you buy at a restaurant to eat at home ↗to go, takeaway, for here'>takeout</b> menus is ok, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Ross, I'm gonna use yours, ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pshhshhh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler? Give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.<br>
[Chandler and Monica head out with some <b title='things'>stuff</b>. Phoebe comes out of her room with a bag.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, why, why is your bag moving?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's not!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Seriously, it's moving!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What the hell is in there?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's just my knitting, that's all! (A dog <b title='stick - put'>sticks</b> its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks <b title='↗bewildered, bemused, perplexedconfused'>puzzled</b>.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
<s>Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't <b title='spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hang out</b> here more often?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hm, that's my pie!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Which smells delicious!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-oh! Uh-oh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) <b title='Yes'>Yep</b>! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding <b title='food that has been cut into small pieces and placed inside vegetables, chicken etc ↗filling, mince, chop, grind'>stuffing</b> to a dog!
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey are feeding the dog as the phone rings.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing <b title='house'>residence</b>. How can I help?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry, who's this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Tell her, I'm <b title='If you are allergic to sth, you become ill or get a rash when you eat it, smell it, or touch it'>allergic</b>, and I will <b title='make a legal claim against sb ↗plaintiff, defendant, judge, jury, attorney'>sue</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, there's no dog here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes there is! He-he's black and white and <b title='shaggy hair or fur is long, thick, and messy'>shaggy</b> and [Cut to Monica's apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Where are you? (Looks around.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> there!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>.) They're here already? How're they doing this?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gets up and opens the door) Hi, Tag! What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Tag</i>I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still <b title='in effect'>good</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?<br>
<i>Tag</i>We uh, kind of broke up this morning.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohio! Thank you!<br>
[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Huh! Where is the dog?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What dog? There-there's no dog here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah that dog left! (Confused) (To Ross) Wait a minute, I thought we agreed to say... your thing, yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, <b title='open doors ↗"hang up" means the same as "hang", wait up, help out'>open up</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>There's no dog in here.<br>
[The dog <b title='↗woof, meow, purr'>barks</b>.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, our hiding-the-dog plan <b title='we have made good progress so far in our journey or project'>is off to a great start</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What is it doing here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Extremely allergic, ok? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's odd, <b title='because'>'cause</b> this dog's been living here for the past 3 days.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it still has to go, all right?<br>
<i>Monica and Phoebe</i>Why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, it's um...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(interrupting him) Don't do it!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Don't do what?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Joey) I have to! Ok? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do") Ok, I hate dogs.<br>
<i>All</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you crazy?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you out of your mind?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Told <b title='you'>ya</b>. (Waves bye-bye.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They're <b title='needing and wanting a lot of love and attention'>needy</b>, they are <b title='tend to jump / nervous and anxious'>jumpy</b>, and you can't <b title='know'>tell</b> what they're thinking, and that scares me a little bit.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a <b title='a special food that tastes good, esp one that you do not eat very often'>treat</b> out of my hand!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, you are not allergic? I mean, does that mean you're not allergic to wool either?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You bought me a pink <b title='a high neck that folds over ↗polo neck, v-neck'>turtleneck</b> sweater.<br>
<i>Monica</i>The guy in the catalog <b title='pull off - succeed in doing sth'>pulled it off</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even <b title='puppy - a young dog'>puppies</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(scared) Is there a puppy here?<br>
<i>Tag</i>You don't like puppies?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Tag) Ok, you are new!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not liking ice cream.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You don't like ice cream?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's too cold.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, just the dogs make me a little uncomfortable.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Ok, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>.) Oh my God!<br>
[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my <b title='a standardized test for most college admissions in the United States. The older SAT (before 1995) had a very high ceiling. In any given year, only seven of the million test-takers scored above 1580. A score above 1580 was equivalent to the 99.9995 percentile. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">Wiki</a>]'>S.A.T.s.</b><br>
<i>Monica</i>1250.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Damn, I forgot you were here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Um, when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you <b title='↗do sth, take action'>make a move</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I'd say about a month.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? I'd say 3 to 4.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Interesting.<br>
<i>Monica</i>When it's your assistant, I would say never.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-<b title='idea'>point</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Huh. A moo-point?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's <b title='if a cow moos, it makes a long low sound ↗oink, baa'>moo</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just <b title='be sensible, reasonable ↗logical'>make sense</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Please don't listen to Joey, ok? Pl- Would you look at him? (Points to Tag) I mean he-he's obviously <b title='very unhappy ↗melancholy, distressed, depressed, dejected, oppressed'>depressed</b>. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs <b title='at the present time'>right now</b> is for you to be his friend.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Ok, that's what I'm gonna do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.<br>
<i>Chandler (entering wearing the pink turtleneck sweater)</i>Ok. I'm keeping my end of the <b title='agreement'>deal</b>. Why is the dog still here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We are leaving.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. Bye-bye. (sits on the couch and starts talking to Joey and Ross) I could pull this off right?<br>
(Ross looks at him completely speechless).

[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How are you <b title='"hold up" means the same as "hold" - withstand stress, pressure etc ↗hang in there'>holding up</b>?<br>
<i>Tag</i>Not bad.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So were you guys together a long time?<br>
<i>Tag</i>A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='because of sth, as a result of sth'>Now that</b> she broke up with you?<br>
<i>Tag</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Hmmmm.<br>
<i>Tag</i>It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and that all that was just a <b title='a basic fact that you accept as being true'>given</b>. But <b title='recently'>lately</b> it's like <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> it's not. You ever have that feeling?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No... Yeah, <b title='↗continuously'>all the time</b>, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I <b title='form an opinion after thinking about a situation'>figure</b> it... it has to <b title='issue in a result, prove effective or successful'>work out</b>.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because, uh-it has to.<br>
<i>Tag</i>You really have all the answers, don't you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Hey, thanks for talking to me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on, what a boss is <b title='used for stating a purpose'>for</b>? Hug <b title='depression, sad feelings etc'>it</b> out! (They hug)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should <b title='try to get'>go for</b> it!<br>
<i>Tag</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(realizes what he said) Street noise <b title='if a loud noise drowns out another sound, it prevents it from being heard'>drowned any of that out</b>? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, ok... (Turns away embarrassed)<br>
<i>Tag</i>What did Joey say? I like you back?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very <b title='not feeling at all confident'>insecure</b> about my back, and, and... you're hugging me, so <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> you are not <b title='if sb/sth repulses you, they are so unpleasant that you feel slightly sick when you see them or think about them =disgust ↗recoil, repel'>repulsed</b> by it, yeah!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth, um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Wow. (He starts to walk towards the <b title='a metal fence that is made of a series of upright bars ↗handrail, banister'>railing</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I admit it. I have a <b title='a strong feeling of romantic love'>crush</b> on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and <b title='used for emphasis'>the last thing</b> I want to do is-is to <b title='freak sb out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak you out</b> or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if-if you said something, right about now.<br>
<i>Tag</i>(looking at the street) Oh my God! Those guys are stealing my car! (He points down to the street.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Tag</i>Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?<br>
<i>Tag</i>I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, <b title='they go there'>there they go</b>, ok. (She hurries in, too)

<i>Monica</i>That's not gonna work.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...<br>

<i>Ross</i>Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why not?<br>
(We can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I, I should go in there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because you <b title='↗give away, send for'>sent away</b> the dog!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend... Phyllis... take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you <b title='understand'>see</b>? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Ok, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica's <b title='completely'>all</b> upset, because I sent Clunkers away.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ross, you need some help?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗snobbish, patronize, despise, arrogant, condescend, smug'>From you</b>? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sits down next to Ross) First of all, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Utah_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Utah_in_United_States.svg/270px-Utah_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Utah</b>? <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, you can't just <b title='make up - invent'>make stuff up</b>!
<s>Ross' Apartment. Chandler is looking for Clunkers.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, Clunkers. Come here, you big gerbil. Clunkers? Where's my Clunkers, my little- No no no I'm not going to do that voice! Clunkers. (Chandler see that he left Ross' door open.) Oh no no no no no no no.

(Exits Ross' apartment and closes the door) Not you <b title='used to address a woman in a polite and respectful way'>ma'am</b>!<br>
[Time lapse, Ross still laying a lot out the states.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.<br>
[Joey stands up again. Rachel enters the door]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, ohh! Why, damn it, why did I open my mouth? (In a <b title='looking or behaving like a young girl ↗girly, girlie, feminine'>girlish</b> voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) <b title='↗jee, geez, jeez, Jesus'>Gee</b>, I'm-I know that I freaked him out.<br>
<i>Joey</i>If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh- What was I thinking? I work with this man. I have to see him every day. How did this happen to me? Oh, wait, that's right. It was because of you! (Hits Joey a little)<br>
[Rachel walks past Joey towards the couch]<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, Umm, I think I can help you. You want me, you wanna know what to do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Please help me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok ok. Now, all right, you, you're gonna wanna talk to him about this, right? But trust me, Rach, that'll only make it worse. You have to deny everything! That conversation out there, never happened!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, I don't think that's gonna work. It was a pretty long conversation.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wo-oh! There was no conversation!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, Joey, I am just gonna talk to Tag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Who's Tag? There's no Tag!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, this conversation is over.<br>
<i>Joey</i>See? It works!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(opens her bedroom door and <b title='=peep'>peeks</b> out) Hey, is Chandler here?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, he uh went for a walk.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, well you cannot tell him... but look who's back!<br>
[The dog barks, runs out of Phoebe's room and jumps onto the couch]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>) Hi!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You think?<br>
[The door opens and Chandler comes in. Rachel covers the dog with a blanket]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi, honey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? Why, why would...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. You know, for you, and...(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must've <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which <b title='used esp in short business notes and emails, when you are telling sb sth they need to know'>FYI</b> Ross, one of your neighbors, growing <b title='marijuana [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana">Wiki</a>]'>weed</b>. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We have good news, look who's back!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(uncovers the dog) Hi!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Clunkers?! Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right, she came back all by herself.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's a Thanksgiving <b title='an action or event believed to be caused by God'>miracle</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must've seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she <b title='tap - hit lightly'>tapped</b> on the window with her <b title='tiny'>teeny</b> little paw <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> we ran to let her in...(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went too far, didn't I? When should I've stopped?<br>
[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="It's your decision ↗call">It's up to you</b>.<br>
[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, hi! How're you doing?<br>
<i>Tag</i>I'm ok. I gotta go down to the police station and look at <b title='The purpose of the mug shot is to allow law enforcement to have a photographic record of the arrested individual to allow for identification by victims and investigators.

<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Thanks for having me over, you guys.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't even <b title='get to'>get a chance to</b> talk. Uh, so, where, where did you say you're from again?<br>
<i>Tag</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Colorado_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Colorado_in_United_States.svg/270px-Colorado_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Colorado</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map <b title='dejected - unhappy, disappointed or lacking hope'>dejectedly</b>.)<br>
[Rachel and Tag go into the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the <b title='a flat outdoor area next to a building or on a roof, where you can sit outside to eat, relax etc ↗balcony, patio'>terrace</b>.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah, I-I never should've said what I said. It-you know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, ok? Big day Monday, lots to do. So, <b title="↗cool, good">we ok</b>?<br>
<i>Tag</i>Um, I'm not.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God, I know it, I freaked you out.<br>
<i>Tag</i>No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Tag</i>Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well, that's one <b title='subtracting, minus'>less</b> thing we have to do on Monday.

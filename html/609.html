<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>. Everyone is there. Ross is standing behind the couch.</s>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='ponder - consider'>ponders</b> something) Hey, you guys ever wonder why they call it <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving">Wiki</a>]'>Thanks-giving</b>? (Makes a 'Pfft' sound with his lips)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(goes entirely off-topic) Ok. (goes to sit down next to Monica on the couch) Hey Monica you're-you're doing Thanksgiving next week right? <b title='because'>'Cause</b>-uh Carol is taking Ben to her parents' place in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-Florida_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Florida_in_United_States.svg/270px-Florida_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Florida</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, ok. (real excited) I'll make Thanksgiving dinner! You don't have to beg.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I didn't beg. I-I just asked once.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(disappointed) You could beg, you know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(real excited) Monica said I could make dessert this year!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh- you're <b title='going to'>gonna</b>... cook something?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, I cook!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Offering people <b title='chewing gum'>gum</b> is not cooking.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you sure Monica said you could make something this year? 'Cause I remember her saying in two years. (to Monica) You said in two years right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(a little hesitant now) No... I... I promised her. But uh, Rach... are you sure you'd <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='start ↗help out'>start out</b> with something as big as Thanksgiving dinner? I mean maybe... you wanna try a little, Thanksgiving breakfast? maybe Thanksgiving snack?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-? <b title='exclamation indicating the belief that sth should have been considered obvious to sb else'>Come on</b>, you guys, I can do this. Remember I made those peanut butter cookies?<br>
(Everybody acts <b title='not at all ↗euphemism'>less than</b> <b title='enthuse - make sb interested in sth or excited by it ↗enthusiasm'>enthused</b>)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know what you guys are so worried about. Cooking is easy. You just follow the recipe. If it says boil two cups of salt, you just boil two cups of salt.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica is mixing some Thanksgiving <b title='a special food that tastes good, esp one that you do not eat very often'>treat</b> (I'm assuming mashed potatoes) in a bowl.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Ok, great! Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='"Guess Who&#039;s Coming to Dinner" made him the top box-office star of that year. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_poitier">Wiki</a>]'>Sidney Poitier</b>? (Laughs).<br>
[Chandler throws his coat on the couch]<br>
<i>Monica</i>(not amused by Chandler's joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!<br>
[Monica goes to <b title='touch or move sth with many small quick movements of your fingers'>fiddle</b> with something on the table.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, and you know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.<br>
[Monica goes to the <b title='↗oven'>stove</b>.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(shocked at the news) Why can't I tell them that we live together?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because they don't know we're <b title='date - have a romantic relationship'>dating</b>. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why haven't you told them?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just <b title='appearing, arriving, happening, etc quickly or unexpectedly ↗out of the blue'>out of nowhere</b>, I didn't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why wouldn't they be happy?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, um, because, mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? Why? Why?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe because you used to be <b title='unfriendly and deliberately not talking to other people'>aloof</b>, or that you're really <b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastic</b>, or that, you know, you joke around <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>. Or that you take off your clothes and you throw them on the couch.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, it'll be ok. It'll be ok. Because when they <b title='↗come by, stop by'>come over</b>, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> we'll tell them.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You really think that'll work?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, I can be <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> charming, <b title='used for talking to a close friend or sb you love'>babe</b>, I won you over, didn't I?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='↗embrace, huddle, cuddle, snuggle'>hugging</b> Chandler) I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
<s>Joey and Janine's, Joey and Ross are playing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation">Wiki</a>]'>Sony Playstation</b>. Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! Your parents like me, right?<br>
[Chandler goes to stand to the side of the TV.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well Monica just told me that they don't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(not paying attention) Yeah, they don't like you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(annoyed) Do you know why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I <b title="don't know">dunno</b>, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or-or, I dunno, maybe it's 'cause you're-<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(angry) Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!<br>
[Joey and Ross get annoyed with Chandler's <b title='a sudden forceful expression of emotion, esp anger ↗lose it'>outburst</b>.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, eh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe I give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well maybe I love <b title='you'>ya</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>[<b title='mock - make sb/sth look stupid by copying them ↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mimic, mime, simulate'>mocks</b> that last comment].<br>
[Chandler starts to leave as Janine enters]<br>
<i>Janine [to Chandler]</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi.<br>
[Chandler exits]<br>
<i>Janine</i>Hey guys!<br>
[Joey and Ross drop their video game controllers.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don't wanna play video games, Joe!<br>
<i>Janine</i>Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah, why? <b title="'Is there anything wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Janine</i>Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving <b title='in or towards the northern part of a city or town, esp if there is not much business or industry there'>uptown</b>. I thought you guys might like to come.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='seriously'>For real</b>?<br>
<i>Janine</i>No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ye-ye, we go to yours, yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>, 'cause it's my sister. But, uh, you know, actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.<br>
<i>Janine</i>(not sure of what to <b title='have a particular opinion about or understanding of sb/sth'>make of</b> that) Ok.<br>
[Janine leaves]<br>
[Ross looks at Joey <b title='coy - pretending to be shy or modest'>coyly</b>.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is watching TV; Monica is <b title='↗make the bed'>setting the table</b>, and Rachel is in the kitchen cooking.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey Mon, look! I'm melting <b title='a dairy product made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter">Wiki</a>] <img src="800px-Milkproducts.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Milkproducts.svg/800px-Milkproducts.svg.png">'>butter</b>. (<b title='completely'>all</b> proud of herself)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's great Rach. You now have <b title='Butter becomes liquid between approximately 82 degrees F (27 <sup>o</sup>C) and 97 degrees F (36 <sup>o</sup>C), which means it can even melt on a hot day.'>the cooking skills of a hot day</b>. (Rachel doesn't know what to make of that comment.)<br>
(Phoebe enters with a paper turkey.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Pheebs, <b title='look at it'>check it out</b>. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English <b title='a cold British sweet dish made of layers of cake, fruit, jelly, custard, and cream [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifle">Wiki</a>] <img src="File-Trifle_4layer-1.jpg" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trifle_4layer.jpg">'>trifle</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, you know, 'cause Rachel's dessert is... [about to say "bad"] so good, that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!<br>
[Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel laugh]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(worried) Nothing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, sweetie, I-I trust you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, if-if I <b title='mess up - spoil/ruin'>mess this up</b>, there's nothing else for dessert?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're not gonna mess it up.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.<br>
[Joey and Ross enter.]<br>
<i>Joey and Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh, look food smells great, Mon!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, and the place looks so nice!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, and hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>The Girls</i>Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, this's been great!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='see you later'>See you</b>!<br>
[Joey and Ross go to the door, ready to leave.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you going?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, oh, we <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> say we'd <b title='make a short visit to a place or person, esp while you are going somewhere else'>stop by</b> this little thing Joey's roommate is having.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, Janine, the really <b title='sexy'>hot</b> dancer girl?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Some would say she's attractive, yes.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And who else is going to be there?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, some of her friends, yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Her dancer friends?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='feeling annoyed, upset, and impatient, because you cannot control or change a situation, or achieve sth ↗desperate'>frustrated</b>) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they, be drinking and dancing, and we really wanna go!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Joey) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, <b title="everything were ok">we were good</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very <b title='-y - having a quality or feeling'>Thanksgivingy</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the <b title='name given to the English Puritans who went to America in1620 and founded the colony of Plymouth, Massachusetts [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_%28Plymouth_Colony%29">Wiki</a>]'>Pilgrims</b> uh, sat down to dinner.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah, and then the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(gets up from watching TV) <b title='fella - an informal way of referring to a man ↗dude, buddy'>Fellas</b>, I really think you should stay here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're just jealous 'cause you can't go.<br>
(Monica turns her head to look at Chandler.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Nods his head) That is so not true. (As soon as Monica turns her head back around, he <b title='mouth - form words with your mouth but not make any sound'>mouths</b> "Yeah I am" to Joey and Ross)<br>
[Enter Jack and Judy Geller]<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Hello, everybody!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Hi!<br>
<i>All</i>Hi!<br>
[Kisses and hugs are exchanged.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Dad [kisses Jack], mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is, it's Chandler!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(<b title='not at all'>less than</b> pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you here, let us take off your coats!<br>
[Chandler goes to take off Jack's coat. He then notices little white <b title='flake - a small flat piece of sth'>flakes</b> on Jack's shoulders. He begins to wipe them off.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Whoa, snowing out there?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>(angry) <b title='↗dandruff'>No</b>.<br>
[Time lapse. The <b title='a group of people'>gang</b> is sitting down for Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is at the head of the table, Mr and Mrs Geller are to his right. Joey and Ross are to his left. Monica is serving things. Phoebe is in the living room and Rachel is at the sink.]<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about <b title='↗live on/off, earn/make a living'>doing this for a living</b>.<br>
[Chandler, trying to make nice with Jack, laughs at his joke and points at Jack.]<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Ok, I have <b title='small white pieces of dry skin in your hair'>dandruff</b>. There's no need to laugh and point.<br>
[Monica rushes over to Chandler's side.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>dad, uh, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>My joke wasn't funny.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well Chandler laughs at everything. That's-that's one of the great things about him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Whoa. (points towards Monica because of what she just said and laughs)<br>
[Phoebe walks from the living room to the kitchen and talks quietly to Rachel.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. You know, I mean he used to be just, you know "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's-he's "Jack Geller, dream <b title='a sexually attractive man with a big strong body ↗sturdy, stout, stocky, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_%28comics%29">Hulk</a>]'>hunk</b>."<br>
[We see a shot of Jack stuffing his face with food. <b title='remarkable (sarcastic)'>Some</b> dream hunk!]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know. You know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're <b title='changing clothes'>changing</b>."<br>
[Time lapse. Ross and Joey are cleaning the table while Judy and Phoebe talk <b title='near/beside, close to'>by</b> the window. Jack and Chandler are sitting on the couch while Monica sits on the coffee table.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's <b title='used for emphasis'>very</b> best friends!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>(deadpan) Yes, I know.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, you know I've always felt that how a young man <b title='end up; result'>turns out</b> is a reflection, on his father.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I always thought that too. Tell me, what <b title='does'>'s</b> your father do?<br>
[Chandler and Monica exchange worried looks.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Worried) He's the <b title='the main performer'>headliner</b> of a, gay <b title='a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque">Wiki</a>] <img src="400px-The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg/400px-The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg">'>burlesque</b> show.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Rach, you're killing us here, will ya serve the dessert <b title='used as an intensifier to express exasperation or impatience'>already</b>? Those drunken dancers are waiting!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(looking at her trifle) Look at it, isn't it beautiful?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah, what is it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of <b title='light and sweet sponge cakes roughly shaped like a large finger.

<i>Ross</i>Wh-what was the one <b title='immediately'>right</b> before bananas?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me too. But then, you know, I-I thought "well, there's <b title='mincemeat - a sticky mixture of small pieces of dried fruit [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincemeat">Wiki</a>] <img src="267px-Mince_Pie_open-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Mince_Pie_open.jpg/267px-Mince_Pie_open.jpg"> ↗mince - cut food, esp meat, into very small pieces'>mincemeat</b> pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, you know?

<i>Ross</i>Ok, remember, we were young. Ok, <b title='Spring break (also known as March break, spring vacation, Mid-Term Break, study week, reading week, reading period, or Easter holidays in the United States and some parts of Canada) is a recess in early spring at universities and schools in various countries in the northern hemisphere. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_break">Wiki</a>]'>Spring break</b>, <b title='a student in the second year of college or high school. ↗freshman, sophomore, junior, senior'>sophomore</b> year, I-I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?! Why did you do that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, aheh, yours-yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it'd matter.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How could it not matter?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, <b title='used to say that the next thing is even more unlikely'>let alone</b> you-you would be living with my sister?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What about all that "friends forever" <b title='things'>stuff</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know, I-I was <b title='completely'>all</b> high.<br>
 (Monica enters the room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Your parents caught Ross smoking <b title='cannabis (marijuana)'>pot</b> in college and he blamed it on me!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, ok? So, will you fix this?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='=all right'>Alright</b>, alright, now-now who should I say <b title='trick - cause sb to do sth by means of a trick ↗persuade, conceive'>tricked</b> me into doing it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nobody! You're gonna go out there (points) and tell them exactly what happened.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(upset) Yes! (Ross starts to leave) Ok, good. Oh wait, is there anything else I should know?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(stops) No...Oh..yeah, um, (laughs a little) you microwaved <b title='a (large) number of'>a bunch of</b> my dad's records. (laughs again)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(mocks Ross' laugh) Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(nervously) <b title='↗clearly, apparently, decidedly, obviously'>Evidently</b>, you-you weren't very good at handling your high. (finally leaves as Monica and Chandler stand there with disbelief)
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Time lapse. Jack is still on the couch, <b title='↗pick nose, snot, bogie, bogey'>picking</b> his teeth with his feet on the table. Phoebe and Judy are sitting on the table looking at him. Ross and Chandler are sitting by the window talking. Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen <b title='fool with - touch/play with =mess with'>fooling with</b> Rachel's trifle. Monica walks into the living room from the kitchen.</s>
<i>Monica</i>dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Monica, <b title='stop annoying or upsetting him'>leave him alone</b>!<br>
[Monica gives Phoebe a surprised expression and goes over to Ross and Chandler.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b> when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! Huh? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot!?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, 'cause it's so romantic.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're whipping so slow! Can't you do it any faster?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?" Ok?<br>
[Joey gives her an understanding look.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh I am!<br>
[Chandler and Monica are by the window pressuring Ross to tell his parents the truth.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, fine!<br>
[Ross gets up to go tell his parents.]<br>
[Joey rushes over.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Ok.<br>
[Monica and Chandler make "What was that?" <b title='gesture - a movement of the hands, arms or head, etc. to express an idea or feeling ↗signal, motion'>gestures</b>. Joey and Ross go into Rachel's old room.]
<s>Rachel's old room, Ross and Joey enter.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, when everyone eats that... that... banana-meat thing, they're all gonna <b title='↗laugh at, tease'>make fun of</b> her, you want that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok, we'll just <b title='cause/persuade sb to do sth'>get</b> everyone to act like they like it. That-that way no one makes fun of her and we still get to go to <b title='a traditional side dish (a small amount of food such as a vegetable that you eat with a main meal) in the Southern United States'>Sweet Potato Pie</b>! (Referring to the dancers.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(scolding) Dude, they're not objects.<br>
[Ross makes a sorry face.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Just kidding, I'll talk to them, you <b title="take sb's attention away ↗divert, avert">distract</b> Rach.<br>
[Joey and Ross go back out into the main area.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok...<br>
[The hallway. Rachel and Ross go out and they just stand there for a few seconds.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title="'Is there anything wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b>, Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, um... Thanksgiving. The <b title='The Christmas season, also called the holiday season, the festive season, or simply the holidays... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_season">Wiki</a>]'>holiday season</b> is <b title='if an event or time is upon you, it is going to happen very soon'>upon us</b>, hm?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>And um...You look nice today.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(shocked) Eh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know, a holidays can be <b title='a rough period is one in which you have a lot of problems or difficulties =tough'>rough</b>. You know? And it's probably really hard for you, to be alone <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(cutting her off) You're alone.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!<br>
[Inside Monica and Chandler's. Joey is almost done explaining the situation to everyone.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some <b title='nonsense ↗incoherent, unintelligible'>gibberish</b> words to indicate to Ross that he's not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Ok, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! Smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), ok?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.<br>
[Ross and Rachel re-enter.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, you're gonna have to stop <b title='rush - make sb hurry'>rushing</b> me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(happily) Really?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Ok, everybody, it's trifle time!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>now</b>, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It sure is.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow. So then did you make it with beef or eggplant?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Beef.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohh no.<br>
[Phoebe gets up and goes into Rachel's old room, a smile on her face.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
[Rachel hands Monica a plate. Monica takes a spoonful of the whipped cream portion.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> take a bite with all the layers!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. [Takes a bigger spoonful and a pea falls off.] Op!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You wait, you dropped a pea.<br>
[Monica puts the pea on top of the spoonful and takes a bite.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It's good!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? How good?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.<br>
[Ross glares at Monica.]<br>
[Everyone takes a bite of their trifle.]<br>
<i>All</i>(faking enjoyment) Mmm.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony, so that I can enjoy the view <b title='while'>whilst</b> I enjoy my dessert.<br>
[Chandler exits to the balcony.]<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(lying) I've <b title='got to'>gotta</b> call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>(also lying) I'll help you dial.<br>
[Jack and Judy exit to Monica's room.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>(again, lying) I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.<br>
[Monica exits to the bathroom.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.<br>
[Rachel reaches for Ross's plate]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross <b title='scarf - eat sth very quickly ↗gulp, swig, down, sip'>scarfs</b> all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he's going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.<br>
[Rachel leaves to the balcony.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>It tastes like feet!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I like it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you kidding?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.<br>
[Rachel and Chandler re-emerge from the balcony.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, a bird just grabbed it, and then, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?<br>
[Chandler makes a fake "I know I couldn't believe it either" gesture.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(lying) Yes, but if it's any <b title='sth that makes you feel less unhappy or disappointed ↗sothe, comfort'>consolation</b>, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.<br>
[Phoebe comes back from Rachel's old room.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the <b title='a comfortable covered armchair'>lounge chair</b>.) Ok, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know, let's see! So, ok, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, because he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so ok, I went to a <b title='an entertainment venue which usually operates late into the night. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub">Wiki</a>]'>nightclub</b>, and I saw him <b title='make out - kiss and touch each other in a sexual way'>making out</b> with a girl.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but then <b title='a French naval officer, explorer, conservationist, filmmaker, innovator, scientist, photographer, author and researcher. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Yves_Cousteau">Wiki</a>]'>Jacques Cousteau</b> came and he <b title='kick ass - punish/defeat'>kicked his ass</b> for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet <b title='↗seal, walrus, dolphin, sea lion, mermaid'>seahorse</b>, who, by the way, was totally <b title='if sb comes on to another person, they make it very clear that they are sexually interested in them'>coming on to</b> me, and please, that is not gonna happen.<br>
[Jack and Judy come out of Monica's room and sit down on the couch.]<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i><b title='used as an interjection'>Boy</b>, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Five minutes ago, a <b title='words'>line</b> like that would've <b title='floor - surprise or shock sb so much that they do not know what to say or do'>floored</b> me. Now, nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.<br>
[Rachel and Phoebe walk into the kitchen. Monica comes out of the bathroom and goes over to Ross.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross? Let's go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, yeah, about telling mom and dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, you know what? <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>That's it</b>. You've had your chance.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wha-what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(out loud, to her parents) Mom! dad! Ross smoked pot in college!<br>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Geller</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(in a 5 year old's tone) (To Monica) You are such a <b title='sb who tattles (tell a parent or teacher that another child has done sth bad), used by or to children ↗tell on'>tattletale</b>! Mom, dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?<br>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Geller</i>Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I told you it was Chandler, who was smoking the pot but, it was me. I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>It was you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah and dad, Chandler didn't melt your records. Ross did!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>(to Ross) Is that true?<br>
<i>Monica</i>And dad, you know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your <b title='Playboy - an American men&#039;s magazine that features photographs of nude women as well as journalism and fiction. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy">Wiki</a>]'>Playboys</b>! Ross did!<br>
[The Gellers stare at Ross. Ross looks at his parents with an afraid, shocked look.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, well, <b title='a powerful hurricane that formed during the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Gloria">Wiki</a>]'>Hurricane Gloria</b> didn't break the <b title='a sheltered area at the entrance to a building'>porch</b> swing, Monica did!<br>
[The Gellers glare at Monica.]<br>
[Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the table, looking at the Geller <b title='sibling - a brother or sister'>siblings</b> like they're <b title='weirdo - sb who behaves strangely ↗freak, creep, psycho, maniac'>weirdos</b>.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!<br>
[The Gellers glare at Ross.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica and Chandler are living together!<br>
[The Gellers glare at Monica, shocked]<br>
[Monica and Chandler both are shocked. Ross gives Monica a "take that!" look.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross married Rachel in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas">Wiki</a>] <img src="350px-Downtownlasvegas-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Downtownlasvegas.JPG/350px-Downtownlasvegas.JPG"> <img src="270px-Nevada_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Nevada_in_United_States.svg/270px-Nevada_in_United_States.svg.png">'>Vegas</b>! And got divorced! Again!<br>
[The Gellers glare at Ross.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(reading the recipe magazine, finally <b title='figure out - think about a problem or situation until you find the answer or understand what has happened'>figuring out</b> that...) I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='pound - hit sth very hard'>pounding</b> the table) I wanna gooooooo!<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(rubbing her <b title='temple - the flat area on each side of your head in front of the top of your ear'>temples</b>) That's a lot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright, Joey, if you wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship <b title='be too difficult for me to understand'>is beyond me</b>.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>And we kinda of figured about the porch swing.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>What happened, son?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!<br>

You've been Ross's best friend all these years, <b title='stick by - remain loyal to a friend when they have done sth wrong or have problems'>stuck by</b> him during the drug problems. (Ross gets <b title='very annoyed or upset'>disgusted</b>.) And now you've <b title='if you take on a job or responsibility, esp a difficult one, you accept it'>taken on</b> Monica <b title='↗too, also'>as well</b>. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.<br>
[Chandler is <b title='extremely'>mega</b> shocked!]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thank you!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(In a parent-like tone) I'll talk to them!
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Everyone is helping clean the table.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No it isn't, I ate that.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>(pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nope, got it, and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So Chandler, are you gonna <b title='continue with'>stick with</b> that bird story?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It was a big bird, <b title='if a bird or aircraft swoops, it moves suddenly down through the air'>swooped</b> (motions) <b title='exactly'>right</b> in there. (Rachel smiles)<br>
(Janine enters)<br>
<i>Janine</i>Hi.<br>

<i>Janine</i>Hi, nice to meet you. (to Mr. Geller) I think we've already met.<br>

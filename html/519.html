<s>Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready for a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> with Monica as Ross enters.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month <b title='the day on which an important event happened'>anniversary</b>, got reservations at <b title='a 3-Michelin-stars restaurant [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Georges">Wiki</a>'>Jean Georges</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! How'd you get in there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, made a few calls, <b title='pull strings - secretly use your influence with important people in order to get what you want or to help sb else'>pulled some strings</b>, and they agreed to <b title='arrange for sb to sit somewhere'>seat</b> us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nice.<br>
(There's a knock on the door and Chandler answers it. It's the pizza delivery girl.)<br>
<i>Delivery Girl</i>Hi, Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>It's uh, 27 dollars <b title='exactly expressible in integers, or in tens, hundreds, etc, without fractional parts'>even</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, ok. (Hands her the money.) <b title='here you are'>Here you go</b>.<br>
(The duck starts <b title='↗chirp, cluck, oink'>quacking</b>.)<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Hey, where's the chicken?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, he's in the back. The duck <b title='piss sb off - annoy sb very much'>pissed him off</b>, said that eggs came first.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>(laughs) Thanks. I'll see you later!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, bye!<br>
(He closes the door and turns to see Ross glaring at him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What the hell was that?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The <b title='flirt - behave as if sexually attracted to sb, although not seriously ↗hit on'>flirting</b>! Aren't you supposed to be <b title='↗ask out, date'>going out</b> with um I don't know hmm let's say my sister?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was not flirting.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wh-, it was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some <b title='whine - make a long high sound because you are in pain or unhappy'>whiney</b>, <b title='a sound or voice that is nasal comes mainly through your nose'>nasal</b> noises.)"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok first of all, the impression, <b title='very strange and difficult to explain'>uncanny</b>. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>Oh, yeah, right</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You <b title='want to'>wanna</b> see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(backing away) <b title='I&#039;m ok / No thanks / I&#039;m fine, I don&#039;t need it. [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091027113011AAnRBrW">link</a>]'>I'm good</b>, I'm good.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are in the kitchen.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be on <b title='an American police procedural and legal drama television series [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order">Wiki</a>]'>Law & Order</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, no, because first they arrest the guy <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> they <b title='examine sb accused of committing a crime in a court of law ↗defendant, plaintiff, judge, witness, jury, attorney'>try</b> him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't <b title='begin to complain or be annoying in some way'>get me started on</b> that.<br>
(Ross and Chandler enter with the pizzas.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was not flirting.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And on your anniversary, <b title='you should feel ashamed'>for shame</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler was <b title='hit on - talk to sb in a way that shows you are sexually attracted to them'>hitting on</b> the <b title='sexy'>hot</b> delivery girl!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was not and oh God, shh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I'm sorry but you were! Ok? And besides, if anyone should be hitting on her, it, it's the guy who's single, Ok? the guy who, who-who can do something about it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sounds like someone wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?<br>
(Ross looks at Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ro-ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's ok that we <b title='be seeing sb - be having a romantic relationship with sb'>see</b> other people.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I-I was watching her <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> at the pizza place.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hm-mmm.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And she was just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, you know what? We don't need her <b title='the sizes of various parts of your body, esp your chest, waist and hips'>measurements</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(looking through the pizzas) Ok <b title='a spicy pork or beef sausage [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperoni">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_Kartoffelpizza_med_rosmarinpesto-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_Kartoffelpizza_med_rosmarinpesto.jpg/220px-Flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_Kartoffelpizza_med_rosmarinpesto.jpg">'>pepperoni</b>, pepperoni, pepperoni, Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my <b title='relating to or intended for vegetarians (sb who does not eat meat or fish)'>vegetarian</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I will turn on the charm, oh Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See? Vegetarianism <b title='benefit - help/give an advantage'>benefits</b> everyone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='Important'>Big</b> night!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah it's so cool!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-nonnie, Nonnie's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family who's always believed me. (To his grandmother in Italian.) <b title="you Nonnie, I'm number one?">si Nonnie, Sono il numero uno</b>?<br>
<i>Joey's Grandmother</i><b title='you'>si</b>, Big star. My big fat Joey star. (grabs his stomach)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I uh weighed like <b title='12.26 kg'>27 pounds</b> when I was born so...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ummm. So umm, when I was in the shower, I was thinking about our first night in London...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, Joey's grandmother is <b title='exactly'>right there</b>. (Points)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is that the one who speaks English or the one who doesn't?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, that one doesn't.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I got you <b title='modifies "wear"'>tonight</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, that's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(runs over to Phoebe) You've got to go home!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But I like it here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me ok? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, well I think that they're in my <b title='handbag'>purse</b>. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for <b title='them'>'em</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Great!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, umm, ok, yeah, I'll be, I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> back. (Goes to her room.)<br>
(Phoebe then gets <b title='controlled by an evil spirit'>possessed</b> <b title='because'>'cause</b> she starts <b title='talk using strange words as part of a religious experience'>speaking in tongues</b>. She speaks Italian to Joey's grandmother. She is quickly <b title='exorcize - force an evil spirit to leave a person or place by using prayers or magic'>exorcized</b> and returns to speaking in English. Of course, to most people English is a strange language <b title='↗too, also'>as well</b>. But none of them are probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. So why am I talking about them? I have absolutely no clue. Moving on...)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title="Excuse me ma'am, would you like something to drink? [<a href='http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091109154012AAfhSP3'>link</a>]">Scusi signora, vuole bere qualche cosa?</b><br>
<i>Grandma</i><b title='No, thank you.'>Niente, grazie.</b><br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title="You're very pretty!">Lei è molto bellina!</b><br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I guess so. (See, the brief <b title="a situation in which sb's mind is being controlled by sth evil">possession</b> didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh what, you-you want both of them? It is a little greedy don't you think?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title="Any child can tell you that the sole purpose of a middle name is so he can tell when he's really in trouble.">Rachel Karen Green</b>, where's the other earring?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, ok, ok, look, just don't <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak out</b>, but I kind of lost it. Oh! I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, what am I gonna tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know, tell her to wear her own earrings.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>These are her earrings.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her <b title='things'>stuff</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because I lose her stuff!<br>
[<b title='a period of time between two events'>Time Lapse</b>, the <b title='a group of friends'>gang</b> is now watching Law & Order. By the way, the entire rest of the episode takes place in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? <b title='"apartment" looks like the noun of "apart"'>Something to think about</b>.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, now you see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna <b title='hit sb/sth hard'>bash</b> his head in later.<br>
(His grandmother asks him something.) (<b title='Where is Joey?'>Dove è Joey?</b> Dove è Joey?)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh umm, my big scene's <b title='come up - come ↗show up, hang up'>coming up</b>. Big scene coming up.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If you said, "Big <b title='flat round beans that are light green in colour and are eaten as a vegetable [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_bean">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Phaseolus_lunatus_MHNT.BOT.2008.1.40-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Phaseolus_lunatus_MHNT.BOT.2008.1.40.jpg/220px-Phaseolus_lunatus_MHNT.BOT.2008.1.40.jpg">'>Lima bean</b>, <b title='producing bubbles'>bubbling up</b>." Would she understand the difference?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What're you doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh I, I just can't watch. It's too scary!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's a diaper <b title='an ad on TV or radio'>commercial</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yeah, well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!<br>
(There's a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Pizza delivery!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over.) (to everyone) Uh, how<b title='does'>'s</b> my hair look?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, it hasn't moved since 1996. (Ross <b title='mock - laugh at sb, often by copying them in an amusing but unkind way'>mocks</b> her.)<br>
(Ross opens the door.)<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>One vegetarian pizza. It's $12.50.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I <b title='by chance'>happen to</b> like 8-year-old boys.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I mean, (some noises) no-no, the uh, your hair, <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>, your hair, you said you thought that your hair looked like an 8-year-old's, and I'm, I'm just saying I like it. The hair.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Oh. Thanks.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>You know, all I'm <b title='anticipate/expect'>looking for</b> is the money.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Here you are'>Here you go</b>. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're welcome.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You couldn't let me have her, could you?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>This is a girl I really like and you, you had to <b title='move quickly and confidently. if a bird or aircraft swoops, it moves suddenly down through the air ↗dive'>swoop</b> in there!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's ok. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No big deal, I do it <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you, you flirt with guys all the time?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, but there is a big difference all right? You are a lot hotter than that I am.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, this actually bothers you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, it <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> bother me! I think it'd bother a lot of people. Rachel, when uh, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And thank you, for that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But you know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? (<b title='mumble - speak unclearly and quietly so that the words are difficult to understand ↗unintelligible, incoherent'>Mumbles</b>) What-what, what're talking about? It-it worked with you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! You know what? No, you're right! We met, you flirted and then bam nine years later you had me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm gonna do? I am gonna order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you-I will show how well I flirt. In fact, I will, I will, I will get her phone number!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well-<br>
<i>Ross</i>And not the one on the menu!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>On your <b title='a dressing table or chest of drawers <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Dressing_table_%28PSF%29.png/220px-Dressing_table_%28PSF%29.png"> <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/ChestOfDrawers.jpg/220px-ChestOfDrawers.jpg">'>dresser</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, that is the one we already have!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Ok, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling) Well, what is it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(smiling) What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(smiling) Are-are you sure?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(smiling) Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) I'm in it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(smiling) This is terrible, what are you gonna do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) I don't know. Well this little old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of <b title='Joey was in the show'>Days of Our Lives</b> she almost died.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(not smiling) That's not good.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Yeah we had to get her a home nurse.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(not smiling) Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) Yeah, she almost died and got really <b title='If you are expansive, you talk a lot'>expansive</b>. You're not smiling. Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? I mean it's not your fault.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freak her out</b> soon?<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>(Something in Italian to Joey.) (<b title='When is your scene *?'>Quando è la tua scena *?</b>)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-uh, soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. I- There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>(pointing at the screen) No! <b title='an American actor [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Waterston">Wiki</a>]'>Sam Waterston</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no, no, that-that's me, that's me.<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>No, it's Sam Waterston! <b title='a 1989 existential (relating to human existence and experience) drama [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_and_Misdemeanors">Wiki</a>]'>Crimes and Misdemeanors</b>, <b title='a 1978 science fiction thriller movie [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_One">Wiki</a>]'>Capricorn One</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Doesn't know "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.<br>
<u></u>
(Phoebe gets up.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we'll leave as soon as the show is over.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But I already gave them back to you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, you didn't.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Rachle, where's that other earring?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Ok! (Goes to the door.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to <b title='become involved'>get into</b> that now?!<br>
(Rachel <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for Joey and Chandler's and Phoebe heads for the kitchen to find Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza <b title='work out - bring about by action, issue in result'>working out</b> for <b title='you'>ya</b>? Huh? You and those vegetables <b title='like or dislike sb/sth very much'>have a real uh thing</b> going on, huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you like it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, that would be, "Why are you being <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b>?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I'm working on my flirting.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh! I did not <b title='understand'>get</b> that.<br>
[Cut to Chandler and Monica on the couch.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, it's good.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and you flirted with every guy in <b title='The most frequently referenced tri-state area is that associated with the New York metropolitan area, which covers parts of the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-state_area">Wiki</a>]'>the Tri-State area</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother <b title='used to tell sb to be quiet'>shush</b> them and wave them away, which they do.) Ok, let me <b title='understand the facts of it and be able to tell it correctly ↗get/put sb straight, put it this way'>get this straight</b>, it's ok for you to flirt, but not for me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I'm so glad we <b title='clear up - explain or solve that, or make that easier to understand'>cleared that up</b>. Look, I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and for women.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. Go on, teach me something about men and women.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy, you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used to tell sb that sth is impossible'>No way</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's true.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well that's pathetic!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Again true.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And <b title='this is true about'>this goes for</b> all guys?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and all guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey! This is like the last commercial. What- You got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know, I know! What am I gonna do? (Thinks) Ooh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='unhappy, disappointed, or sad ↗depressed'>dejected</b>) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>Joey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to <b title='perform using only actions and not words ↗mime'>pantomime</b> it for her.) <b title='in the meantime'>Meanwhile</b>, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.<br>
[Time lapse, Rachel is coming back from Chandler and Joey's.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Did you find it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts them on.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering from her room) Phoebe! (<b title='motion - make a signal'>Motions</b> for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Rachel) What we do?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know, I don't know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='used to express surprise or strong feeling'>gosh</b>, she's gonna kill me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I suppose I could tell her it was just all my fault.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh that'd be great!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mon, can I talk to you for <b title='a short time'>a sec</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, what is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(shocked) Wow! All right, well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it, you lost it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I will <b title='if you replace sth broken, damaged or lost, you provide a new one'>replace</b> it, I promise. I feel so terrible.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look at you! Come here! (They <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.) Better?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! You're the best!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen, honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in <b title='the attitude of sb who accepts that sth unpleasant must happen and that they cannot change it ↗frustration'>resignation</b>.) Ok?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my blue sweater, it's my sunglasses!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Your sunglasses?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>(from outside) Pizza!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Ok, <b title='used when you are starting to do sth (esp sth difficult or dangerous)'>here goes</b>. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, <b title='wait'>hold on</b>. (Pauses as he <b title='ready - make sb/sth ready for sth'>readies</b> himself.) Ok. (Walks away.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right thing to... (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You'll see. Ok. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?<br>
<i>All</i>Caitlin!<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>Caitlin!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Huh, it's uh, $12.50.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, (gets the money) um, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>No, actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Gas? Wow! <b title='↗V(voltage), R(reistance), I(Intensity)'>Intense</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Caitlin) Hey, uh, you know that smell gas has?<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>(wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible, horrible place) Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>They put that in.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>The gas is <b title='having no smell ↗aroma, incense'>odorless</b>, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>(getting more desperate to leave) Well ok!<br>
<i>Ross</i>A lot of other gas smells...<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='When in 1937 radio reporter Herb Morrison saw the airship Hindenberg bust into flames, blurted "Oh, the humanity!" meaning sth like "what terrible human suffering!"

<i>Caitlin</i>You know what, umm, actually I, I really, I should go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>You know what? That's ok, you guys've ordered so many that this one <b title='used to say I am going to pay for sth'>is on me</b>! (Runs for her life.)<br>
(Ross closes the door slowly.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To All) Was I talking to her about gas?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>More <b title="used instead of repeating an adjective that has already been mentioned (e.g. He's stupid, more so than his sister.)">so</b> than anything else.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I-I-I <b title='thought/felt ↗establish'>found</b> it interesting.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, no-no, hey, hey, can you believe, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(walking over to Ross) Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What else do they add smell too?

<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? People with all the pizza?<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Oh, is there a problem?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. no, no. Every thing's- they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, he just gets really nervous when he's flirting.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Oh my God! That was flirting?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, uh he's-he's really a good person.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>The guy with the gas?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. I'm-<b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b> he's really <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b> and he's really funny and he's just ugh, just got a good heart.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>You know, actually, I did think that he was cute and then he started talking.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>See, there-<b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right'>there you go</b>. And, besides, I- you know, I think he really likes you.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>I- you should- I thought Joey was there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.. no.. but just I'm telling you he's worth a <b title='attempt/try'>shot</b>.<br>
<i>Caitlin</i>Well, if he's so great why don't you <b title='↗ask out, date, see'>go out</b> with him? (Rachel thinks about that for a few seconds.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hmm. Well, you know, <b title='at some moment in time that is not made specific'>at some point</b>, uh, you and I may need to have a longer conversation.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey's grandmother are still watching Law & Order.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just <b title='meet sb when you did not expect to ↗bump into, run over'>ran into</b> Caitlin in the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b> and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>And she just gave you this?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, thanks, but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well that I can believe.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey! Is the show still on?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Almost over <b title='used when addressing sb'>man</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Nonnie. Oh! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope">Wiki</a>]'>Pope</b>?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCR">Wiki</a>]'>VCR</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why am I looking?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, Nonnie, here I am, look, this's my big scene!<br>
(Joey has made a little home movie that's his big scene. He <b title='brace - push part of your body against sth solid in order to make yourself more steady'>braces</b> himself against the door to his apartment and while holding a plastic gun and wearing the same sweater says...)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on the tape) All right back off! I got a gun! I'm not afraid to use it!<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>Oh Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's right, Nonnie!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You couldn't 've at least changed your shirt.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on the tape) Now, I want a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck <b title='↗chirp, cluck'>quacks</b>, to the duck) Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it...(the duck quacks louder) Shoo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on the tape) I'm coming out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Phoebe) And she's supposed to <b title='believe'>buy</b> this?!<br>
<i>Grandma Tribbiani</i>Joey, <b title='well done ↗applaud, clap'>bravo</b>! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)<br>
(Suddenly, the tape cuts away from Joey's <b title='done or said without earlier planning or preparation'>impromptu</b> scene, to Chandler standing really, really close to the camera.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(singing) Ground control to <b title='an officer of middle rank. ↗captain, major, lieutenant, colonel'>Major</b> Tom! <b title='commence - begin/start'>Commencing</b> <b title="10...9...8...7...">countdown</b>... engines... on!<br>

<i>Joey</i>(to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I am definitely gonna watch that!
<s>Monica and Rachel's, another time lapse, Monica is seeking advice from Rachel and Phoebe about possible replacement earrings.</s>
<i>Monica</i>What about these? These look the same?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Definitely!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Not as each other!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, then no.<br>
(Goes over to Chandler.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You ready?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me see the earrings.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, honey, the earrings...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>My boyfriend really does have some great tastes.<br>
(He turns to get his coat and Monica gives Rachel and Phoebe two thumbs up as Chandler walks over to Ross.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) Thanks for <b title='pick out - choose from a group'>picking out</b> the earrings man.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hm-mmm.<br>

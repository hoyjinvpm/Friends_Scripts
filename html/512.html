<i>Ross</i>I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I, hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (Chandler laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why would I be mad?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, because you know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't <b title="have a sexual relationship with sb else's wife, boyfriend etc">fool around with</b> your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(realizes what Ross just said and the <b title='a possible future effect or result'>implications</b> to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all the things on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I also want you to remember, that I let you live here, rent free!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. <b title='having no special conditions'>No strings attached</b>. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down- let's write it down!<br>

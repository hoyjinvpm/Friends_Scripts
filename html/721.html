<i>Monica</i>Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)<br>
<p style="margin-left:1em;font-style:italic">
Many know the Shriners as "those guys who drive around in go-carts and wear funny hats." However there's much more to the organization than a fondness for toys and questionable taste in headwear. The Shriners, a part of the Indiana Jones-sounding "Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine," are a philanthropic fraternity with a "serious purpose." Their main mission is to raise money for Shriners Hospitals for children. They accomplish this through events (like the Shrine football game) and personal donations. Becoming a Shriner isn't easy. In fact, those who wish to join must first reach the rank of "Master Mason" within the Masons. The Shriners' famed hat is known as a fez. Although it might seem a strange choice of headwear, the attention-drawing fez serves as an effective symbol and helps increase public awareness of the group. For the Shriners, the pointing and giggles from lookie-loos are a small price to pay for visibility.

<i>Phoebe</i>He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and <b title='into public view or knowledge'>out in the open</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh! I like that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Phoebe) Oh, ok! Show him your <b title='↗panties, lingerie'>bra</b>! He's afraid of bras! Can't <b title='manipulate - work skilfully to achieve the result that you want'>work</b> <b title='them'>'em</b>! (He <b title='swift - happening or done quickly and immediately'>swiftly</b> rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Not my first time.
<s>Cut to the bathroom.</s>
<i>Monica</i>You go back out there, and you <b title='persuade sb to have sex with you ↗entice, tempt, suggestive, provocative'>seduce</b> her till she <b title='crack - go crazy'>cracks</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, give me a second! (Pause) Did you <b title='clean ↗hang up (hang), help out (help)'>clean up</b> in here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Of course.
<s>Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, you-you-you're going?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is <b title='showcase - exhibit, display, show'>showcasing</b> her bra.) So, this is my bra.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You should be. I'm very <b title='flexible or pliable (easily influenced and controlled by other people)'>bendy</b>. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not if I kiss you first.<br>
(They move closer together and Phoebe <b title='↗unwilling, reluctant'>hesitantly</b> puts her hand on Chandler's <b title='the area at either side of the body between the top of the leg and the waist'>hip</b>. He puts his hand on her waist, but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe then grabs his butt. Chandler <b title='go for - choose'>goes for</b> her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Here it comes. Our first kiss.<br>
(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is <b title='squint - look at sth with your eyes partly closed in order to see better'>squinting</b>. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! Ok! Ok! All right you-you win! I can't have sex with <b title='you'>ya</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And why not?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because I'm in love with Monica!!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're-you're what?!<br>
(Monica comes out of the bathroom like <b title='a bolt of lightning'>a bolt</b>, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Love her! That's right, I LOVE HER! I love her! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you too, Chandler. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>that's it</b>! It's over! Everybody knows!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well actually, Ross doesn't.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him <b title='now or in the immediate future (used in negatives or questions)'>yet</b>.
<s>Cut to later in that episode. Ross is showing his boss his new place.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh... What're you doing?! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!
<s>Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Joey and Ross are talking.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, your friend's getting married, it's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> change things.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You really think it would be that different?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How could it not be? I mean <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b> with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo">Wiki</a>]'>Volvo</b> <b title="a business that sells a particular company's product, esp cars">dealership</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, things change.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It'll be ok, Joe.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sorry, I just... I like things the way they are.
<s>Flashback to the <b title='group of people'>gang</b> in Central Perk in <a href="108.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/108.html">Nana Dies Twice</a>, they're all <b title='go through - look at, examine'>going through</b> an old photo album.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, who's this little naked guy?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, that little naked guy would be me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aww, look at the little thing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who are those people?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="I don't know">Got me</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, that's <b title='grandmother'>nana</b>, <b title='exactly'>right</b> there in the middle. Let's see. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at <b title='the oldest coffee roaster in Des Moines, Iowa. [<a href="http://www.javajoescoffeehouse.com/shop/">Wiki</a>]'>Java Joe's</b>'.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?<br>
<i>Monica</i>1939... yeah, 24, 25?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh, it's like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looking) No-no, that would be me again.

<i>Monica</i>Yeah, Just <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
(They spilt into their sexes and the girls read Monica's and the guys read Chandler's. The girls <b title='breathe in suddenly'>gasp</b> and <b title='make a long deep sound =moan ↗grunt'>groan</b> and the guys laugh <b title='hysterical - unable to control your behavior or emotions'>hysterically</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Monica) Oh, that's beautiful.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Chandler) (laughing) Funny <b title='joke, story etc'>one</b>! That's good!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?<br>
(Ross laughs.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? I don't <b title='understand'>get</b> it.<br>
(Ross points to the explanation and he gets it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) Oh man, this is <b title='extremely funny'>hilarious</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.

<i>Chandler</i>Ok, what'd you guys think?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(quietly) <b title='used to address sb ↗fella, pal, buddy, man'>Dude</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(starting to cry) I have never known love like this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You really like it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Dude! How-how did you write this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I stole Monica's and changed the name. Shh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You can't do that!<br>
<i>Joey</i>If he goes first he can!<br>

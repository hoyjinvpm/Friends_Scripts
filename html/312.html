<i>Ross</i>All right that's it!! Get off, get off her! (Pushs Mark off her)<br>
<i>Mark</i>What is going on?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what's going on?! (Throws the love bug at him) That, I'll tell you what's going on!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Now standing behind Ross) Ross!<br>
(Ross finally looks at the woman kissing Mark.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (Turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)

<i>Joey</i>So, does that mean the audition is off?<br>
<i>Director</i>Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and teach them the combination.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?!<br>
<i>Director</i>Aw Joey, come on, it's easy. You know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (Very quickly, Joey watches, stunned) up, <b title='in ballet, step, step, change [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pas_de_bourr%C3%A9e">Wiki</a>]'>Pas de bourrée</b>, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand <b title='A jump done from two feet to one foot'>sissone</b>, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, look what I got Julio.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, it's a vase.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, just like the one in the poem.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, well, not exactly like the one in the poem.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. (<b title='↗embrace, huddle, cuddle'>Hugs</b> her)
<s>The Moondance Diner.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?<br>
<i>Julio</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write <b title='sth that deceives sb, or makes things appear different ↗practical joke'>trick</b> poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And you know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when my <b title='a weekly American magazine of celebrity and human-interest stories <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Beyonce%27s_People_Magazine_Cover.jpg/220px-Beyonce%27s_People_Magazine_Cover.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_magazine">Wiki</a>]'>People magazine</b> comes on Saturday, and the new <b title='a specialty retail chain in the U.S. that sold home organization and storage solutions.

<i>Julio</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You don't even know me...<br>
<i>Julio</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Julio</i>The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby <b title='a Spanish and Portuguese word meaning precious or beautiful'>preciosa</b> you make me so sad that you would think this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, it's, my friend Phoebe's...<br>
<i>Julio</i>No, it's, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are the opposite of what you mean'>sarcastically</b>) Oh yeah.
<s>Joey's audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.</s>
<i>Director</i>All right, let's do it!<br>
(The group does the same horrible dance that Joey did earlier in the show, except they're all out of sync and they do the jazz hands at the end.)<br>
<i>Director</i>No, no, no. What was that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know, it's the best I could get out of <b title='them'>'em</b> all right.<br>
<i>Director</i>Well, people!<br>
<i>Joey</i>People, people, people.<br>
<i>Director</i>Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. (to Joey) Show 'em how it's done.

<i>Ross</i>A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this uh, this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.<br>
(Gunther is eavesdropping in the background.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, why is it hard, we've been together for almost a year now?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and, I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else isn't gonna take you away.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Let it be me! Let it be me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (She kisses him)<br>

Why, is that ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sure, is she married?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ahh, no.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Huh. (Starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you jealous?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Noo, I, you know I just don't <b title='understand'>see</b> why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she, you know, have any other stripper mom friends of her own?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You are totally jealous.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw, I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people, feeling certain things, you know, about strippers. And you know, and um, I...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Honey, I love you too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait, wait, wait.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours, you know.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. Either that, or you just <b title='turn on - make sb sexually excited'>turned him on</b> and sent him off to a stripper.<br>

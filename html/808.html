<i>Rachel</i>I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> come?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure. Yeah, he's <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> sexy.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so, we'll just <b title='invent, think of'>come up with</b> some kind of signal if it's going well you can <b title='leave'>take off</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him that I'm <b title='↗condom, diaphragm'>pregnant</b> yet.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Because I know he's <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid =freak out'>flip out</b> and I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> it when he's angry.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used for showing that you are surprised or a little annoyed'>Gosh</b>. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.

<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you could've untied it with your hands.<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You went home with the waitress.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah, that was a <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> good night.<br>

Are you an <b title='↗imbecile, retarded, moron, dork, doofus, bonehead'>idiot</b>? Is that why you're a waiter?<br>
<i>Waiter</i>This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight! (Runs off.)<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>Oh <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>! Don't be such a baby! (Goes after him)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No it's ok, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> the baby will tell him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why, so he can get mad at the baby?<br>

<i>Dr. Green</i>(laughs) Pappy. (To Phoebe) Oh, I'm gonna be a pappy. (Stops laughing) Oh, so when is the wedding?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The who?<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>The wedding! There's going to be a wedding.

<i>Ross</i>Oh, thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could <b title='↗focus, closely, intently'>concentrate</b> and you know take it all in.<br>

<i>Mona</i>Oh, hey, thanks again for showing me your <b title='partly'>semi-</b>precious stone collection. It was amazing! (She leaves.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>My God! You must be good in bed!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So uh, you and Mona, it's been <b title='a period of time'>a while</b> now. How's it <b title='go - happen'>going</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ah, it's good. It's going, it's going good. I mean, we-we <b title='have a friendly relationship'>get along</b> great. She's, she's so...<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='sexy'>Hot</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I-I was gonna say <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, but yeah-huh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And she's ok with Rachel and the baby?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I-I don't wanna scare her off, you know?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you have to be honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh good, <b title='because'>'cause</b> <b title='until now'>so far</b> in this marriage, I just like you a lot.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. So I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so, tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I got this number from <b title='↗colleague, co-worker'>this guy at work</b>, and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife <b title='If you say that sb is a member of a hall of fame, you mean that they are one of the most famous people in that area of activity.'>hall of fame</b> <b title='used for emphasis'>or what</b>?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Will you let the lady talk?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better. I got you party hats, and <b title='pornography - pictures, videos etc that show sexual acts and images in a way that is intended to make people feel sexually excited'>porn</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Throw in my father <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b> with the <b title='sb whose job is to entertain people by performing magic tricks =conjurer ↗illusionist, wizard'>magician</b>, and it's just like my 14th birthday <b title='everywhere, in all repects. respect - a particular feature or detail'>all over</b> again. Look, I, appreciated it, but uh, it's a little <b title='strange in a way that makes you feel nervous ↗weird'>creepy</b>. You know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month <b title='a date when you celebrate sth that happened before'>anniversary</b> present.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure, one year is <b title='<a href="http://www.purpletrail.com/partytrail/special_occasions/anniversary/paper-wood-silver-a-complete-list-of-traditional-anniversary-gifts">Paper, Wood, Silver – A Complete List of Traditional Anniversary Gift Themes</a>'>paper</b>, but two months is <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lap_dance">Wiki</a>]'>lap dance</b>! (Joey nods his agreement.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And Joey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. All right, <b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>now</b> who else do you wanna invite?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, actually, sorry I can't even <b title='be able to go to an event'>make it</b>. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I understand, I mean who would cancel an actual <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> just to go to a fake bachelor party?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(on cellphone) I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...

<i>Rachel</i>II-um- daddy, stay calm. Please.<br>
<i>Dr. Green</i>Stay calm?! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!

<i>Ross</i>Probably shouldn't touch me.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Should I leave this open for you too?<br>
<i>Mona</i>I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.<br>
<i>Mona</i>Yeah? Well you still <b title='should have'>shoulda</b> told me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you <b title='↗sarcastic'>heard it from Rachel's father</b>. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only 'cause I really, really like you. Really!<br>
<i>Mona</i>Ok, I guess you can...close the door now. (He does so and they kiss.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, <b title='used to say you understand and accept what sb says'>fair enough</b>.
<s>The delivery room, later on, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Frank are there as Dr. Harad is checking out Phoebe.</s>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>Ok, you're <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth#First_stage:_active_phase">Wiki</a>]'>ten centimeters</b>. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.<br>
(They all kiss her and wish her luck.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bye Dan!<br>
<i>Dan</i>Uh, bye Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Bye, momi-moo.<br>
(Everyone except Frank leaves.)<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>All right, I need a <b title='a tool used for holding or fastening two things together firmly'>clamp</b>, <b title='completely clean, with no bacteria'>sterile</b> towel, and channel 31.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What is that?<br>
(Dan turns on the TV and the Happy Days theme song comes on.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the <b title='a pair of small drums that you play with your hands'>bongos</b>. All right, are you ready? It's time to try pushing.<br>
[Cut to Joey's room, his doctor and Ross are there.]<br>
<i>Joey's Doctor</i>Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey <b title='make a face - put on an expression'>makes a face</b> like he is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing. (Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)<br>
[Cut to the delivery room.]<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>You know, push! <b title='you did it right'>That's it</b>, push! Just <b title='focus'>concentrate</b> on pushing! Yeah, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>!<br>
<i>Dan</i>I see the head.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Yes, it has a head!<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>All right. Let's keep pushing! Come on!<br>
<i>Frank</i>I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? That's my son.<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>All right. Here's your first baby.<br>
[Cut to the waiting room, a <b title='showing that you are very pleased or excited about a victory or success'>triumphant</b> Frank rushes in.]<br>
<i>Frank</i>YESSSSS!!! Yes! We got a baby boy!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Frank</i>Frank Jr. Jr.!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, how does he look? How does he look?<br>
<i>Frank</i>So <b title='very unpleasant to look'>gross</b>! (He runs back to the delivery room.) {The image of newborn babies is largely distorted by the media these days. We see chubby, bright eyed, smiling babies. This means that when your baby is born, you might be in for quite a shock as to what a real, healthy newborn looks like in person. This is a guided tour of some of the elements of newborn appearance that might surprise you.

[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is about to give birth to the middle kid.]<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>Ok. You ready to push again?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I already had a baby. <b title='leave sb alone - stop annoying/upsetting sb'>Leave me alone</b>.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Ok, ok, come on, you can do it. You can do it!<br>
(Phoebe screams in pain, and Frank screams with her.)<br>
[Cut to the waiting room, a twice triumphant Frank returns.]<br>
<i>Frank</i>Yeah! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)<br>
[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is at it for the last time.]<br>
<i>Frank</i>Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!<br>
<i>Dr. Harad</i>Yep. All right, he's coming. He's coming!<br>
(They both stare at the newborn.)<br>
<i>Frank</i>Hey, where's his thing?<br>
[Cut to the waiting room, a thrice triumphant Frank returns again.]<br>
<i>Frank</i>Chandler's a girl!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh God, <b title='the first year of formal education in the U.S., for children aged 5 or 6'>kindergarten</b> <b title='a very clear memory of sth unpleasant or painful that happened in the past ↗nightmare, ring a bell, remind'>flashback</b>.<br>

Chandler's a girl!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, keep saying it!<br>
<i>Alice</i>(Running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!<br>
<i>Frank</i>No-no-no, everything's ok. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.<br>
<i>Alice</i>We have our babies?<br>
<i>Frank</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Alice</i>(Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.<br>
(They hug. And quickly that hug turns into a heated <b title='kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>make out</b> <b title='a period of time used for a particular activity'>session</b>, <b title='exactly'>right</b> there on the waiting room couch. Chandler, Rachel, and Monica quickly make their exits.)
<s>Joey's room, he is recovering from his birth.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You did it, man.<br>
<i>Joey's Doctor</i>Would you like to see them? (He hands Joey a little jar.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)
<s>A <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>, Monica and Dan are talking.</s>
<i>Dan</i>So I'll call you tomorrow.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Great!<br>
(Dan leaves as Chandler enters.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the <b title='based on a strict way of understanding or explaining'>technical</b> definition, is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. You know. But if you have this <b title='recently designed or produced (showing disapproval or distrust)'>newfangled</b> dictionary that gets you mad at me, then we have to, you know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think you're better than you think you are.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? Ok, so...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Interrupting) Know when to stop.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're <b title='agreed, in a satisfactory state'>ok</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Right!
<s>The delivery room, everyone except Rachel is there. Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are holding the babies.</s>
<i>Monica</i>I think you're my favorite.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Which one do you have?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't care.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, you know...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, umm, no, honey.<br>

Hey, you guys, can I just have, like a second alone with the babies.<br>
<i>All</i>Ohh. Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.<br>
(They hand her the babies and leave them alone.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, here you are. God, it seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little <b title='a shallow glass or plastic dish that biologists use to culture cells or small moss plants. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Wiki</a>]'>Petri dish</b>. Everyone said <b title="the process by which a baby is pushed from its mother's body during birth">labor</b> was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong, this is. Well, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Ok, I'll <b title='accept'>settle for</b> being your favorite aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Ok, so we're <b title='calm and relaxed'>cool</b>. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little <b title='a celebratory hand gesture [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_five">Wiki</a>]'>high fives</b>! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
<s>The delivery room, everyone is <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b> with Phoebe. Frank, Alice, and the kids aren't there.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So does it really hurt as bad as they say?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. You won't be able to <b title='↗go through, undergo'>take</b> it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So uh, <b title='because of sth, as a result of sth'>now that</b> little Chandler <b title='turn out - prove to be, end up, result'>turned out</b> to be a girl, what're they gonna name her?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They're gonna call her Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Kind of a, <b title='with qualities considered typical of men ↗feminine'>masculine</b> name, don't you think?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Works on you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And maybe they can girlie it up a little bit, um, like Chandlerette.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alice called her, um, Channy-Fanny.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ha-ha. Channy-Fanny. (Points to Chandler)<br>

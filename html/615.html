<i>Chandler</i>So, it seems like this uh <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Wiki</a>]'>Internet</b> thing <b title='has become a part of life and will continue to be so'>is here to stay</b> uh?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's ok not to talk.<br>
(Rachel enters)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Ross) What is the matter with you?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! Barry and Mindy.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who's Barry and Mindy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Barry was the guy that I almost married and Mindy was my best friend.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why did they get divorced?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, <b title='used to say that you have heard that sth is true, although you are not completely sure about it ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b> she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? (<b title='giggle - laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way ↗chuckle, grin'>Giggles</b>.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> divorced.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Which time?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a <b title='↗gay, heterosexual, homosexual, come out (of the closet)'>lesbian</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(starts to imagine it) I can't. I keep seeing it <b title='two hot girls making out'>the good way</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> I'd still be doing my kara-tay. (That's <b title='a Japanese sport or way of fighting [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate">Wiki</a>] ↗kung fu, judo, taekwondo, martial arts'>karate</b>, he's just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from, you know, not doing anything else physical.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you-you wouldn't be <b title='↗ask out, go out'>dating</b> me, that's <b title='certain to be true'>for sure</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure I would!<br>
<i>All</i>(simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah, oh, right!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I just think Monica was that fat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey hey, imagine if I never got fired off <b title='a daytime soap opera broadcast on the NBC TV network. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_our_Lives">Wiki</a>]'>Days Of Our Lives</b>! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Hey, hey, there's Carol again!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What if I had had the <b title='the quality of being brave and determined ↗courage, braveness'>guts</b> to <b title='↗fire, pink slip, lay-off'>quit</b> my job? I'd probably be writing for <b title='an American magazine. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker">Wiki</a>]'>The New Yorker</b>, being paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean, tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What if I'd taken that job at <b title='the investment banking and wealth management division of Bank of America. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch">Wiki</a>]'>Merrill Lynch</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Merrill Lynch?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a <b title='a natural skill or ability ↗talent, gift'>knack</b> for stocks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well why didn't you take the job?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So, I thought, you know, if I'd worked with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat <b title='a filet of cured salmon [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lox">Wiki</a>] A fish fillet is the flesh of a fish which has been cut or sliced away from the bone. cure - preserve meat, fish, or other foods by drying them, or by using smoke or salt <img src="250px-Lox_sandwich_-_01-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Lox_sandwich_-_01.jpg/250px-Lox_sandwich_-_01.jpg">'>lox</b>, and have a pet fox.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ehh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and <b title='things'>stuff</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!<br>

<i>Joey</i>That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," (Made the double-quotation-marks-like gesture.) just a regular famous actor.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rachel, will you stop saying that?! Hey, hey look, remember on the show when, when Caprice was dying and she gave me...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The ring from the cave, yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow! Uh ok, well, uh... (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure! <b title='on condition that, provided that'>As long as</b> they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No-no-no...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes! Yes! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you, are a good person. Ok? Now you had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's <b title='continuing forever ↗eternal'>undying</b> love for her brother.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Look, you want the ring or not?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah!

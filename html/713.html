<s>Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to move Joey's chair and not having much luck at it as Joey enters.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know, I was thinking of moving the couch over here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughs) Why would you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> do that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So that there will be a <b title='of a good enough standard or quality ↗descent, shabby'>decent</b> place for me to sit.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rach, there is a decent place...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And your lap does not <b title='be considered/included'>count</b>! Ok? Come on help me move this.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. No. No.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. Rosita does not move.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...<br>
<i>Joey</i>As in Rosita does not move.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, it's just a chair! <b title='used to say you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>What's the big deal</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>The <b title='sth of great importance or consequence'>big deal</b> is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any <b title='a very bright, unpleasant light ↗reflection'>glare</b> coming off Stevie.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Stevie the TV?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(glaring at her) Is there a problem?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! (Joey <b title='set - put'>sets</b> his beer and bag of chips down and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> into his room.) Oh what <b title='does'>'s</b> he know! Come on Rosita, us <b title='chicka - Misspelling of chica (Spanish for "girl")'>chickas</b> <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> <b title='if people stick together, they continue to support each other when they have problems'>stick together</b>!

<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> have to say, "This is my brother-in-law, Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>(disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.<br>
(Phoebe sits down between Chandler and Ross.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was <b title='check out - look, get information'>checking out</b> the uh, <b title='property in the form of land or buildings ↗realtor, agent, landlord, tenant, lease'>real estate</b> section...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken <b title='a large branch of a tree'>limb</b> out front and the uh, the window in the <b title='a story or room directly below the roof of a building, esp a house'>attic</b>... Oh my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? What happened to the window in the attic?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!<br>
(Ross calls his parents on his cell phone.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes we're surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Joey is examining the injury to Rosita while Rachel is apologizing to him.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, Joey, I am so sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, ok? and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, come on, Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store <b title='at the present time / immediately'>right now</b> and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(slowly turning and glaring at her) She's not even cold <b title='used in negative statements to indicate that sth has not happened up to the present time, although it probably will happen.'>yet</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But don't you think uh Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean, you know, she <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> always put... your comfort first.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's true.<br>
(Rachel turns for the door and makes the "Wow!" face.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(grabbing her coat) Ok? You ready?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I... (<b title='↗turn off'>Shuts off</b> the TV.) I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Ross and Monica are still <b title='continue saying sth or talking about sth'>going on</b> about the house.</s>

<i>Monica</i>As much as they love you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I was their <b title='first child ↗only child'>first-born</b>! They thought she was <b title='not able to produce children or young animals ↗infertile, sterile, conceive, pregnant'>barren</b>! It's not my fault.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ugh, I hate this year!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's wrong with this year?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well ok, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst <b title='tipper - sb who gives tip'>tippers</b> in the world!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That was me and Ross.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh that's right!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know, if you wanna <b title='get'>pick up</b> some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money in college doing uh <b title='a method of direct marketing in which a salesperson solicits prospective customers to buy products or services, either over the phone or through a subsequent face to face or Web conferencing appointment scheduled during the call.

<i>Monica</i>Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. You know, I probably wouldn't have to say <b title='[<a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_phone_sex">What is phone sex?</a>]'>spank as much</b>. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah, like you never called!
<s>The telemarketing office, Phoebe is getting shown to her desk by the supervisor.</s>
<i>Supervisor</i>So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and you try to sell as much <b title='a type of ink used in machines that print or photocopy'>toner</b> as you possibly can.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.<br>
<i>Supervisor</i>(laughs) Why don't we do a <b title='an occasion when you try sth for the first time to find out if it will be successful'>trial run</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh ok. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?<br>
<i>Supervisor</i>I'm the supply manager.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, ok I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.<br>
<i>Supervisor</i>We don't need any toner.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh ok, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you're right, this is easy.<br>
<i>Supervisor</i>Ok, what was wrong with that call?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh well, all right... um, <b title='used to tell sb that you hope that what you are going to say or do will not offend them'>no offense</b>, but you were <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> rude.<br>
<i>Supervisor</i>They're always gonna tell you they don't need toner, but that's ok. Because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Supervisor</i>So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is entering.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Joey! Joe! (Sees that he's not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! (He decides it's not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)

<i>Ross</i>Dad?<br>

<i>Mr. Geller</i>Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will <b title='if a check clears, or a bank clears it, the bank allows the money to be used'>clear</b> before they find the crack in the foundation and the <b title='a soft grey mineral that does not burn, used esp in the past in building as a protection against fire or to prevent heat loss [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos">Wiki</a>]'>asbestos</b> in the ceiling.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Monica) Just grab our <b title='things'>stuff</b>, get the hell out of here.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, that's ok, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven <b title='a working toy oven [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Bake_Oven">Wiki</a>]'>Easy Bake Ovens</b> in the attic.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I used to love to play restaurant.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked <b title='a mixture of eggs, milk and flour used in cooking to cover food such as fish or chicken before you fry it, or to make pancakes ↗stuffing, filling, dough'>batter</b> eater.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook <b title='brownie - a thick flat chocolate cake'>brownies</b>! (She goes to the attic.)<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>So, I think your boxes are over here. (They walk over to them.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad, who-whose cigarettes are these?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away. (He puts them in his pocket as Ross finds something of interest in one of his boxes.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Cool! Dad! My <b title="report card - a report of a student's progress presented periodically to a parent or guardian">report cards</b>! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades) Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... (He puts it away and finds something else.) Ooh, my rock polisher!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a <b title='an entertainer who wears funny clothes and a large red nose and does silly things to make people laugh'>clown</b> kit! Clown kit!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Well the white seems to be untouched. (He throws it back into the box as Mr. Geller moves a <b title='a large piece of thick plastic or other material that you put over sth to protect it from the rain =tarpaulin ↗canvas, denim'>tarp</b> and makes a discovery.) Uh-oh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>You know how the garage floods every spring?<br>
<i>Ross</i>How are you <b title='at any time'>ever</b> gonna sell this place?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche">Wiki</a>]'>Porsche</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... (He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God... everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be <b title='crush - make sb lose all hope, confidence etc ↗break down'>crushed</b>!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>You don't secretly smoke do you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>So it's just your mother then.

<i>Phoebe</i>May I ask why?<br>
<i>Earl</i>You wanna know why. You wanna know why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I surely do!<br>
<i>Earl</i>Ok, I don't need any toner because I'm gonna kill myself.<br>
(Phoebe <b title='in a desperate (needing or wanting something very much) way'>desperately</b> tries to find the scripted response to that line.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(doesn't have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?

<i>Earl</i>Ok, so... no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! <b title="used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information">Now</b>, why do you wanna kill yourself?<br>

<s>Joey and Rachel's, Chandler has replaced Rosita with his chair.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Good chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the <b title='the area at the top of the staircase which has rooms leading off it'>landing</b> yet.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You will like it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No I won't.<br>
(Chandler runs to check on them coming up the stairs.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You don't even know!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!<br>
(Chandler throws the back of Rosita into his apartment and quickly starts pushing the base into his apartment.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey you didn't even sit in it. I'm telling you it's such a nice chair.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I feel bad sitting in it so soon.<br>
(Joey and Rachel reach the landing just as Chandler closes the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, you know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Francette? What is she? A couch?<br>
(They enter their apartment.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Poor thing. Cut down in her <b title='the time in your life when you are strongest and most active'>prime</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. You know, start the healing process?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the <b title='an enclosed container for burning waste at high temperatures ↗cremate, crematorium'>incinerator</b>. It's gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back, but it doesn't come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) She's healed!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's weird.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No it's not weird, it's a <b title='an act or event that does not follow the laws of nature and is believed to be caused by God'>miracle</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, <b title='good or impressive in a surprising way'>wondrous</b> things can happen!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, I really don't...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well no.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Miracle!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, you know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Someone like an... angel?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and healed your chair. (She sits down in the chair.) <b title='used to say you think sbmeone has said sth silly'>Please</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(angrily) Get your non-believer ass <b title='out of'>outta</b> my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.)

<i>Mr. Geller</i>(grabbing a glove) This could've been hers!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Where's the logic in that?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>The logic, is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!<br>

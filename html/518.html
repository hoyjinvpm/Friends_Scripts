<i>Joey</i>Ok, pick a card.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (He picks the 9 of <b title='↗Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts'>Spades</b>)<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right now, <b title='↗recall, recollection, ring a bell, remind, learn by heart, recite'>memorize</b> it. (Pause) You got it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Ok. Is that your card? (He <b title='wink - quickly close and open one eye as a sign to sb'>winks</b> and smiles.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pause) Yes.<br>
(Joey laughs then realizes the trick didn't work when Chandler hands him his card back.)<br>
<i>Carol</i>(entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>

<i>Ross</i>(<b title='set - put'>sets</b> Ben down) Well, it's not <b title='certain to happen, definitely ↗certainly, absolutely'>for sure</b> but umm, we met <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute- you know, which he is- umm <b title='used when you are ignoring details so that you can talk immediately about the most important thing'>anyway</b>, we uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's <b title='taking part in an audition (a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc) ↗cast'>auditioning</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial <b title='cast - choose actors'>casting</b> director in town!

(Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>! I've been in that park a million times, no one ever offered me an audition.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the <b title='↗see-saw, monkey bars, jungle gym, climbing frame'>swings</b>...<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='on the swings'>That</b>.

<i>Rachel</i>Uh, well, you know what? I don't know if I feel comfortable stealing on my <b title='used for emphasis'>very</b> first day...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='↗plus'>Besides</b>, if anybody's gonna get free <b title='things'>stuff</b>, it's gonna be me.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I <b title='suggest/suppose'>say</b> we <b title='organize'>throw</b> a surprise party this weekend.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we-we can have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(from the bathroom) Ok!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Done.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, great, so do you <b title='wand to'>wanna</b> do it together?<br>

<i>Monica</i>It's gonna be weird seeing some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Weirder than seeing his two moms <b title='kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>make out</b>? (Monica nods in agreement.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with you and see if I can get an audition as the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're not his godfather.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! Are you kidding?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is <b title='happy and relaxed because sth bad has not happened'>relieved</b>) Ok, let's go, godfather.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right!<br>
(As they walk out he <b title='motion - give sb directions or instructions by moving your hand or head =signal ↗gesture'>motions</b> to Chandler that he is still Ben's godfather.)

Hey, and the other one I know from... (smiles) well you know. (Ross smiles too.)<br>
<i>Carol</i>(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of <b title='a weekly American entertainment-trade magazine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_%28magazine%29">Wiki</a>]'>Variety</b> to read) Hey, that kid looks familiar.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah, yeah! He's done <b title='a lot'>tons</b> of commercials. I've seen him in like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Smacks">Wiki</a>]'>Sugar Smacks</b>, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation">Wiki</a>]'>Playstation</b>, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was maaaad...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. All right? Ben is <b title='by a large amount or distance'>way</b> cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to <b title='make a long high sound'>whine</b> like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great <b title='used for emphasis (as an intensive)'>though</b> if I <b title='get to - have the opportunity to'>got to</b> play Ben's dad?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well, umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this <b title='cloth used for making clothes, curtains etc =material'>fabric</b> (to the other one.) Sorry.<br>
<i>Kim</i>Oh, don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions. And then I <b title='be praised for sth you have done or achieved'>take credit for</b> them- I'm kidding.<br>
<i>Nancy</i>She is kidding, but, don't ever disagree with her again. Ok, now I'm kidding!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.<br>
<i>Kim</i>I don't know which one, but I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> know, I need a cigarette.

<i>Monica</i>That doesn't seem fair.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting poisonous habit!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, it is the best.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> this keeps happening? You know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions, and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, you know?

<i>Chandler</i>You know, we used to have a smoking area at work. It was great. There was this big flowerpot with dirt in it. And we used to <b title='put out - make a fire etc stop burning'>put like our cigarettes out</b> in it. One of the <b title='sb who has been or worked in a place for a long time'>old-timers</b> told me there used to be a little tree in there.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just, say you wanna get some fresh air.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I can do that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, or you can just do the easy thing and smoke. You gotta take long, deep <b title='drag - breathing in smoke'>drags</b>. (pretends he is taking one and then coughs) Wow, I still don't have my lung capacity back yet. (Monica pats him easy on the back.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh good. Yay.<br>
<i>Rachel & Chandler</i>Yay.<br>
(They all start out.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, I changed my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Ok, let's talk about the party! I 've so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>So wow, all right, it looks like you <b title='take care of - deal with'>took care of</b> everything. Thanks a lot, <b title='together, jointly'>co-</b>host.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Whaaat? I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh, like what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Thinks) Cups.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Cups? You're giving me cups?<br>
<i>Monica</i>And ice!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, ok, I will be in charge of cups and ice!<br>

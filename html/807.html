<i>Monica</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
(Monica notices something.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! You cleaned! (<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale, exhale'>Gasps</b>) Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And <b title='nag - keep criticizing/complaining'>nagging</b> works!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know uh, I didn't actually do this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, it wasn't you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well then who?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I got a <b title='a woman whose job is to clean rooms ↗houseboy, butler'>maid</b>. Yay!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(shocked) Well, I hope by maid you mean <b title='a woman who is having a sexual relationship with a married man'>mistress</b>, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh honey, I know you don't like to <b title='give up'>relinquish</b> control...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, relinquish is just a <b title='having a lot of decoration'>fancy</b> word for lose!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, she's really nice. Ok? And she mentioned that she <b title='adore - like very much'>adored</b> the way that you arranged the <b title='sponge - a piece of a soft natural or artificial substance that is used for washing'>sponges</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Did she really say that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, I <b title='clearly'>distinctly</b> remember <b title='because'>'cause</b> I thought it was a joke. <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying or changing the subject">Now</b>, just give her a chance, ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, usually when I'm <b title='as much as shown ↗that'>this</b> anxious, I clean!

<i>Phoebe</i>(looking around) Whose cellphone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I think it's coming from your bag.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(checks) I never get calls! (Answers the phone) Hello?<br>
<i>Eric</i>Phoebe, hi, uh, it's Eric. From the <b title='a yearly celebration observed in a number of countries on October 31 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Wiki</a>]'>Halloween</b> party, Ursula's fiancé.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?<br>
<i>Eric</i>Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! What an <b title='unbelievable'>incredible</b> <b title='an action that breaks a law, agreement, principle etc ↗breach, preach'>violation</b>-and wonderful surprise.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Uh, listen, I just-I thought you should know I <b title='break up - end relationship'>broke up</b> with Ursula.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow! What did he do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Shhh! I'm talking.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Anyway, I was wondering, if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you <b title='↗go out, date, hit on, come on to, flirt'>asking me out</b>? Because it would be <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> weird since you just broke up with my sister.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Yeah uh...ok. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Not great, but we can <b title='try to improve'>work on</b> it at lunch. Ok, I can be at your apartment in two hours.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I've got friends too. Ok, bye.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Bye.<br>
(She hangs up.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be so much better than I thought it was going to be. Oh, Ross, I can't <b title='arrive at/get to'>make</b> lunch. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So <b title='according to the way sth appears ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b> I'm available for lunch.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're moving?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, (in a baby's voice) "How you doing?"<br>
<i>Ross</i>So does-does Joey know you're moving?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be <b title='happy and relaxed because a bad situation has ended'>relieved</b>. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_sickness">Wiki</a>] ↗nausea, nauseous, vomit, throw up, retch, gag'>morning sickness</b> <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.<br>

<i>Rachel</i><b title="used to say that sth is A rather than B">Not so much</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know what, and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the <b title='↗escalator, lift'>elevator</b> this morning that a woman in my building died.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can <b title='visit ↗come by, stop by'>come over</b> whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah that would really be great.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning, <b title='to show respect'>out of respect</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. No. No you're right.<br>
(Pause as they both take another <b title='a very small amount of a drink ↗gulp, swig, down'>sip</b> of coffee.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Shall we?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
(They both exit.)
<s>Ross's Building, they are approaching the apartment of the woman who died. Ross knocks on the door and a woman answers it.</s>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And I'm Rachel, an <b title='↗fan'>admirer</b> of the building.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven <b title='pass away - die ↗pass out'>passing away</b> and I'm so <b title='feeling pity/sympathy'>sorry</b> for your loss.<br>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>She didn't pass away.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>My mother's still alive.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, thank God!<br>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a <b title='strong'>tough</b> old bird.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ahh.<br>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>Are you close with her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah of course! Uh, yeah, she and I would talk <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b> in-in (Rachel <b title='poke - move or push sth through a space or opening ↗stick'>pokes</b> her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>You speak <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language">Wiki</a>]'>Dutch</b>? (In Dutch) <b title="I'm very honored to meet a friend of my mother">Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know I would but it's just too painful.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So she's really not dead.<br>
<i>Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter</i>No, she's <b title='hang in there - continue doing sth in a determined way'>hanging in there</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a, a one bedroom or a two?

<i>Brenda</i>Mrs. Bing, this <b title='a flat piece of baked clay or stone that is used for covering walls, floors etc'>tile</b> cleaner is incredible! Where did you get it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts <b title='a clear liquid with a strong bad smell.

<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) I love her.<br>
<i>Brenda</i>I'll be back in <b title='↗a sec'>a minute</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See? I told you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She stole my <b title='pants made of denim. The jean brand "Levis" is named after the inventor, Levi Strauss. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans">Wiki</a>]'>jeans</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pause) What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She must've been planning this for years!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's- I will prove it to you! Ok? About a week ago, I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the <b title="place where a person's legs, or pant legs, join at the top ↗groin">crotch</b>. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, shouldn't we <b title='accept that she is innocent (not guilty of wrongdoing)'>give her the benefit of the doubt</b> before we go...<b title='snoop - secretly try to get information ↗paparazzo, scoop, swoop, stoop'>snooping</b> around her crotch?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah! (<b title='Like I would tell you'>Laughs</b>.)
<s>Eric's Apartment, he's opening the door to <b title='↗conceal, seal'>reveal</b> Phoebe.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Eric</i>Come in, I'm so glad you're here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, me too. Not in the <b title='shaking ↗tremble, shiver, quiver'>shaky</b> angry way you are <b title='however'>though</b>.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the <b title='agreement to marry ↗betrothed, proposal'>engagement</b> ring back.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just...I get so angry just looking at her...(Looks at Phoebe)...face.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.<br>
<i>Eric</i>I'm sorry. I just...when I look at you, I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, where do you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> eat? <b title='used to say you are not suggesting sth'>Not that</b> I'm not enjoying watching you <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid =freak out'>flip out</b>.<br>
<i>Eric</i>I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe this is too weird.<br>
<i>Eric</i>No, wait! There's only a problem, when I look at you. (Sits down on the couch.) Oh <b title="I've got an idea">I got it</b>! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No don't <b title='remove sth from sth else by pulling it roughly or violently'>tear</b> out your eyes!!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?<br>
<i>Eric</i><b title='weaker "no" ↗no way'>Not really</b>. You...you're <b title='a blurry shape is one that has an unclear outline'>blurry</b>, but you still look like Ursula. You're <b title='blur + Ursula'>Blursula</b>. Ok, wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, not so much. It's kinda hard to have a conversation.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Oh, no-no, sure we can have a conversation. Um... tell me a little something about yourself.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(looks around for who he's talking to) Oh me? Look, Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. You know? This is our first date you know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he <b title='↗intentional, on purpose, deliberate, accidental'>mean to</b> touch my hand?' and you know first kisses and...(He kisses her)...second kisses.

<i>Joey</i>But Rachel has an apartment.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna wanna move.<br>
<i>Joey</i>She is?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I mean you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I guess I didn't really think about it.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Nice jeans!<br>
<i>Brenda</i>Oh, thanks! I like your <b title='any piece of light clothing worn on the part of the body above the waist'>top</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You're not getting it.<br>
(Brenda bends down to use the dustpan and Monica leans over to look for the stain, but leans so far over she falls out of the chair.)<br>
<i>Brenda</i>What happened?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I <b title='↗nod off'>fell asleep</b>.<br>
<i>Brenda</i>I was thinking about taking my lunch <b title='rest'>break</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really <b title='make you hungry ↗appetizer, starter'>work up your appetite</b> for lunch.<br>
<i>Brenda</i>All right.<br>
(Brenda pulls a chair to the counter and uses it to get up on the counter in order to clean the top of the cabinets. Monica <b title='sneak - move secretly ↗sneaker, creep, stealth'>sneaks</b> over, bends over, and tries to see the stain. That doesn't work so she sticks her head between Brenda's legs. Suddenly Brenda changes her <b title='the way in which sb stands ↗pose, posture'>stance</b> and traps Monica's head between her legs.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Brenda</i>What's going on?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm sorry. I've never had a maid <b title='at an earlier time ↗then, once, after'>before</b>, is this not ok?<br>
<i>Brenda</i>I don't understand. Why was your head just between my legs?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's a fair question. Well, my, my head was between your legs uh, because I find you very attractive.<br>
<i>Brenda</i>Are you <b title='come on to - behave in a way that shows sb that you want to have a sexual relationship with them'>coming on to</b> me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Apparently.
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating pizza as Joey returns from the Knicks game.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How was the game?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, it's ok. I...I ate <b title='by a large amount'>way</b> too much.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talking to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street, if <b title='↗this, some, particular'>certain</b> Dutch people would just <b title='give up / stop holding'>let go</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I was kinda hoping you'd stay.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No room? It's a baby. It's like <b title='as much as shown'>this</b> big. (Holds his hands about a <b title='30.48 cm, 12 inches'>foot</b> apart.) You know, you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it <b title='exactly'>right</b> here. (The chair.) Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby? (<b title='mumble - speak unclearly ↗muffle, mute'>Mumbles</b> that it's over in the corner.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to <b title='have sex'>score</b> when there's a screaming baby around.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I <b title='would like to have sth very much'>could use</b> a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would <b title='cause disorder ↗disturb, interrupt'>disrupt</b> your entire life.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I just, I, I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know I blame Ross for this.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I do too a little bit.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm gonna miss you, you're the <b title='most sexy'>hottest</b> <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b> I ever had.

<i>Eric</i>Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, I've got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later?<br>
<i>Eric</i>Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the door.) I love the way you kiss.<br>

<i>Monica</i>No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>God! She is not stealing from us! Ok, will you <b title='let sth go - stop thinking/worrying about sth ↗obsessive'>let this go</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She's wearing my bra!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh dear God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And <b title='nevertheless'>yet</b> you don't recognize that you're crazy?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Here's the plan! Ok? I'm going to leave and you're gonna get a look at Brenda's bra!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Here's another plan...No!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I fear a <b title='↗judge, attorrney, plaintiff, defendant, prosecute'>jury</b> will <b title='understand'>see</b> it the same way!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's <b title='↗boob (job)'>breasts</b> all the time!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?

<i>Joey</i>Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't <b title='accept a situation'>stand</b> being <b title='near ↗by'>around</b> a baby, then maybe I don't wanna be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just <b title='have sex'>do it</b> in the bathroom of the club! You know, but I won't say <b title='things'>stuff</b> like that around the baby.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, are you sure?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, ok? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.<br>

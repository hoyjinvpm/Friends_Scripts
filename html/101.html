<i>Monica</i>There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on, you're <b title='go out - have a romantic relationship ↗ask out'>going out</b> with the guy! There<b title='has'>'s</b> <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be something wrong with him!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a <b title='a raised part on sb&#039;s back that is caused by an unusually curved spine'>hump</b>? A hump and a <b title='a piece of false hair that sb wears over part of their head ↗wig'>hairpiece</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait, does he eat chalk?<br>
(They all stare, <b title='confused =bewildered ↗puzzled, perplexed'>bemused</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Just <b title='because'>'cause</b> I don't want her to <b title='experience a difficult or unpleasant situation, feeling etc'>go through</b> what I went through with Carl, oh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, everybody relax. Relax. This is not even a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>. It's-it's not. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sounds like a date to me.<br>
[Time Lapse]<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the <b title='restaurant (esp in a factory or college) in which customers collect their meals on trays from a counter =canteen'>cafeteria</b>, and I realize I am totally naked.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh, yeah. Had that dream.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then, I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Instead of...?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Never had that dream.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='suddenly'>All of a sudden</b>, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>They weren't looking at you <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Finally, I <b title='think'>figure</b> I'd better answer it, and it <b title='turn out - end up, prove to be'>turns out</b> it's my mother, which is very very weird, because- she never calls me!<br>
[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='extremely offended, embarrassed or ashamed'>mortified</b>) Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>This guy says hello, I <b title='want to'>wanna</b> kill myself.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You ok, sweetie?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small <b title='the long tube in your body through which food passes after it leaves your stomach =gut ↗colon, rectum, anus, bowel, bowl'>intestine</b>, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Cookie?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(explaining to the others) Carol moved her <b title='things'>stuff</b> out today.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ohh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh! Oh! (She starts to <b title='pull sth quickly several times with your fingers ↗eyebrow, chicken, feather'>pluck</b> at the air just in front of Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, no don't! Stop <b title='cleanse - make sth completely clean; make sb/sth morally clean or pure'>cleansing</b> my <b title='a quality or feeling that seems to surround or come from a person or a place'>aura</b>! No, just leave my aura alone, ok?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine! Be <b title='dark and dirty or difficult to see through'>murky</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No you don't.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>And you never knew she was a <b title='a woman who is sexually attracted to other women ↗gay, straight'>lesbian</b>...<br>
<i>Ross</i>No!! Ok?! Why does everyone keep <b title='fixate - always thinking or talking about sth ↗compulsive, obsessive'>fixating</b> on that? She didn't know, how should I know?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to <b title='accept'>take</b> it pretty well.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh really, so that <b title='behaving in an uncontrolled way because you are extremely excited, afraid, or upset'>hysterical</b> phone call I got from a woman <b title='sob - cry noisily while breathing in short sudden bursts ↗weep, whine'>sobbing</b> at three AM, "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?

<i>Ross</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>. You're angry. You're <b title='verb[intransitive] feel pain'>hurting</b>. Can I tell you what the answer is?<br>
(Ross <b title='↗signal, motion'>gestures</b> his <b title='permission/agreement'>consent</b>.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>See but I don't want to be single, ok? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!<br>
(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!<br>
<i>Waitress</i>Can I get you some coffee?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(pointing at Rachel) <b title='decaffeinated coffee. coffee or tea that is decaffeinated does not contain caffeine (=the substance that keeps you awake, excited etc)'>Decaff</b>. (to All) Ok, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln <b title='high school'>High</b> survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sure!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens. He sits back down <b title='sad and unable to deal with problems'>defeated</b> again. A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet <b title='a girl or young woman who helps a bride before and during her wedding ↗maid of honor, best man'>bridesmaids</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh God... well, it started about half an hour before the wedding. I was in <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story, to mention sb/sth without giving a name'>this</b> room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Bow_sauceboat.jpg/220px-Bow_sauceboat.jpg"> a container used for pouring gravy (a sauce made from meat juices, liquid and flour) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravy_boat">Wiki</a>]'>gravy boat</b>.

When all of a sudden I realize- (to the waitress that brought her coffee) <b title='a brand of artificial sweetener [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_%27N%27_Low">Wiki</a>]'>Sweet'n Low</b>, I realized, I realized that I was more <b title='turn on - make sb feel sexually excited =excite, arouse'>turned on</b> by this gravy boat than by Barry! <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> I got really <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked out</b>, and that's when it <b title='if a fact hits you, you suddenly realize its importance and feel surprised or shocked'>hit me</b>: how much Barry looks like <b title='a toy <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Mr_Potato_Head_1952.jpg/300px-Mr_Potato_Head_1952.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Potato_Head">Wiki</a>]'>Mr. Potato Head</b>. You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='if people drift apart, their relationship gradually ends'>drifted apart</b>, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who wasn't invited to the wedding.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an <b title='problem'>issue</b>...

<i>Monica</i>Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big <b title='a musical instrument. see the background'>pipe organ</b>, and she's really not happy about it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='imitate - copy what sb do ↗ape, do, emulate, impersonate, mime, mimic, mock'>imitating</b> the characters) <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Tuna_Salad.jpg/250px-Tuna_Salad.jpg"> a large sea fish [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna">Wiki</a>]'>Tuna</b> or egg salad? Decide!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!<br>
(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If I <b title='stop holding'>let go</b> of my hair, my head will fall off.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ooh, she should NOT be wearing those pants.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I say push her down the stairs.<br>
<i>Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey</i>Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!<br>
(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, '<b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>What if</b> I don't wanna be a shoe?

<i>Ross</i>You can <b title='understand'>see</b> where he<b title='would'>'d</b> have trouble.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look Daddy, it's my life. Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I guess we've <b title='establish - discover or get proof of sth'>established</b> she's staying here with Monica.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!

<i>Monica</i>Joey, stop <b title='hit - talk to sb in a way that shows you are sexually attracted to them'>hitting on</b> her! It's her wedding day!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What, like there's a rule or something?<br>
(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I got it. Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without a <b title='It consists of a large piece of thin cloth attached to your body by strings.'>parachute</b>?" Come on, I can't do this!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You can, I know you can!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't think so.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Cut. Cut...<br>
<i>All</i>Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel! That was a library card!<br>
<i>All</i>Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) You know, if you listen very closely, you can hear a thousand <b title='retailer - a person or business that sells goods to customers in a shop ↗wholesale'>retailers</b> scream.<br>
(She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Welcome to the real world! <b title='sth sucks - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>It sucks</b>. You're gonna love it!
<s>Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by playing the <b title='the official song of a nation that is sung or played on public occasions [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem">Wiki</a>] ↗emblem, logo'>national anthem</b>.</s>

<i>Ross</i>No. No, I gotta go home sometime.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. You're gonna be ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's Paul's watch. You-you just put it back where you found it. Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.<br>
<i>Ross and Rachel</i>Goodnight.<br>
(Monica <b title='stomp - walk with heavy steps or to put your foot down very hard =stamp'>stomps</b> on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sorry-<br>
<i>Ross</i>No no no, go-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, you have it, really, I don't want it-<br>
<i>Ross</i>Split it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, <b title='serious/great'>major</b> <b title='a feeling of romantic love for sb'>crush</b> on you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I knew.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You did! Uh-oh, ok. I always <b title='though'>figured</b> you just thought I was Monica's <b title='boring and not fashionable ↗geek, nerd'>geeky</b> older brother.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I did.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense <b title='sb who is vulnerable can be easily harmed or hurt'>vulnerability</b> become any kind of a <b title='one of several things that influence or cause a situation'>factor</b> here- but do you think it would be ok if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, maybe...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok... ok, maybe I will...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Goodnight.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Goodnight.<br>
(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>See <b title='you'>ya</b>.... Wait wait, hey, <b title="what's with sb - used to ask why sb is behaving strangely">what's with you</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
<s>Central Perk, everyone is there.</s>
<i>Joey</i>I can't believe what I'm hearing here.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? I-I said you had a-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(sings) What I said you had...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Phoebe) Would you stop?<br>

<i>Monica</i>I said that you had a nice <b title='the fleshy parts of your body that you sit on =buttocks ↗bottom, tushie'>butt</b>, it's just not a great butt.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and <b title='part tense of "bite"'>bit</b> ya.<br>
<i>Ross</i>There's an image.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Did you make it, or are you just serving it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm just serving it.<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Kids, new dream... I'm in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas">Wiki</a>]'>Las Vegas</b>. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)<br>
<i>Customer</i>(To Rachel) Ahh, miss? More coffee?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the <b title='group of people'>gang</b>.) Sorry. Ok, Las Vegas.<br>

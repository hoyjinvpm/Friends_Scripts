(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Absolutely.<br>
<i>Amy</i>(very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)
<s>Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk in.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter <b title='come - reach a level, be produced'>coming</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great, I'm <b title='↗done, completed'>finished</b>! <b title='used when you are adding sth to what you have just said, esp sth surprising ↗as a matter of fact, actually'>In fact</b>, I just <b title='drop off - take sb/sth somewhere'>dropped it off</b> at the agency.<br>
(Chandler and Monica look <b title='↗stunned, dumbstruck, dumbfounded'>shocked</b>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You dropped it off?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No can do <b title='[Spanish] friend'>amigo</b>. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to handwrite it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You handwrote it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See you later! (Leaves)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects <b title='orchid - a plant with unusually shaped and beautifully colored flowers <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Haeckel_Orchidae.jpg/220px-Haeckel_Orchidae.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchidaceae">Wiki</a>]'>orchids</b> or has a lot of birds!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, good.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... ok... thank you. Goodbye. (hangs up looking very confused).<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ugh, we're <b title='in trouble or in a bad situation'>screwed</b>, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Still looks confused) They loved it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(surprised) They thought Joey was a child?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.<br>
(Amy comes in with Emma in a <b title='a type of light chair with wheels in which small children can be pushed along ↗stroll, buggy, pushchair, wheelchair, gurney, trolley'>stroller</b>)<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, what'd you guys do today?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Ella wanted to go out, so, we went shopping and got some <b title='a Japanese food that consists of small cakes of cold rice with fish, egg, or vegetables on top or inside [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi">Wiki</a>]'>sushi</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That sounds like fun.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yeah, <b title='used for saying no without being very definite ↗no way, not so much, nope, nah'>not really</b>. Babies are <b title='boring'>dull</b>.<br>
(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?<br>
<i>Amy</i>I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(sounds excited) Yeah!<br>
(Amy takes off Emma's hat)<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title='ta-da - used as a cheerful and friendly interjection in making an announcement etc'>Ta-daaa</b>!<br>
(Rachel looks at Emma)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(not excited anymore) You <b title='pierce - make a small hole in or through sth, using an object with a sharp point'>pierced</b> her ears?!<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?<br>
(Rachel looks very shocked)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? <br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, <b title='used for emphasis'>now</b> would it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, my God, Oh, my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna <b title='become very angry =freak out'>flip out</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)<br>
(Ross enters)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey guys. <br>
<i>Monica and Chandler</i>Hi Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can <b title='almost not =hardly ↗pretty much'>barely</b> see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nah, I don't really want her to see. <br>
<i>Ross</i>Why, why not?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because there are so many terrible <b title='sight - thing you see'>sights</b> in this world.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk <b title='a container for liquids that is made of stiff thick paper ↗cartoon'>carton</b> but it looked like meat?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Come here. Oh! There she is! Hi!<br>
(Rachel looks <b title='↗concerned'>worried</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nothing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly ↗inhale'>gasps</b>). Please tell me those are <b title='clip-on - fastened/attached to sth with a clip'>clip-ons</b>. <br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, they're real!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) Ok, you are soo irresponsible I am never letting you babysit ever again!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hey <b title='You say "guess what" or "(do) you know what" to introduce a piece of information which is surprising, which is not generally known, or which you want to emphasize.'>you know what</b>, this kid needs me, ok? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm a cool, fun aunt!<br>
<i>Amy</i>(Sarcastically) Ok!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to <b title='think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figure out</b> what to do with your life and this is how you <b title='do sth for sb, or give them sth, in return for helping you ↗revenge, avenge, get back at'>repay</b> me?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah? Since when?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Since today... I am going to be, a baby <b title="sb whose job is to cut and arrange sb's hair in an attractive way ↗hairdresser">stylist</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's not a thing!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to <b title='add accessories to sth, esp to the clothes you are wearing'>accessorize</b>, what colors to wear, what clothes are <b title='making you look thinner ↗slim, slender, chubby'>slimming</b>...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.<br>
<i>Amy</i><b title="After Amy enters, babies care if they're slim. enter - start working/an activity">Enter Amy</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...<br>
<i>Amy</i>What? What're you gonna do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!<br>
(Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at Ross who <b title='gesture - make a movement with your hands or head in order to show or tell sb sth ↗signal, motion, mouth'>gestures</b> "later".)

<i>Mike</i>Great game, huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Why do you keep looking at the screen?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm not. I'm <b title='pray - speak to God in order to ask for help or give thanks'>praying</b>. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you <b title='a hammer-wielding god [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor">Wiki</a>]'>Thor</b>! (Mike is standing up) Where-where're you going?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Gonna go to bathroom.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I think you should wait.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't-you don't get all the <b title='any substance which plants or animals need in order to live and grow'>nutrients</b>.<br>
<i>Announcer</i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.<br>
(We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of Mike.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Mike Hannigan, will you marry me? (Mike looks <b title='confused and not certain what to do'>bewildered</b>)<br>
<i>Announcer</i><b title='look at, notice, observe'>Get a load of</b> this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)<br>

(Rachel and Amy enter)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)<br>
<i>Amy</i>You're <b title='kick out - make sb leave a place, job etc =throw out'>kicking me out</b>? <br>
<i>Rachel</i>You put holes in my baby's ears!<br>
<i>Amy</i>Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You know what? <b title='continuously since ↗as of, from now on'>Ever since</b> I got here, you have been nothing but negative.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='said before disagreeing with sb; ↗what, sorry, pardon'>Excuse me</b>?<br>
<i>Amy</i>You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to <b title='de- - used with many verbs, nouns, and adjectives for giving a word the opposite meaning'>de-</b>emphasize her <b title='a mistake, mark, or weakness that makes something imperfect =defect'>flaws</b> (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(yelling) Joey, where are those bags?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of <b title='rubbish'>crap</b>!<br>
<i>Amy</i>You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> fat by the way...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hips or thighs?<br>
<i>Amy</i>Ass and face.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gasps) Oh my God! I thought she was on <b title='The Atkins Diet [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_Nutritional_Approach">Wiki</a>]'>Atkins</b>.<br>
<i>Amy</i>She was. <b title='carb - a food such as rice, potatoes, or bread that contains carbohydrate'>Carbs</b> found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.<br>
<i>Amy</i>You can?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> perfect version of what you are.<br>

<i>Amy</i>Ok.
<s>Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have <b title='testicles =nuts'>balls</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Please, let's just forget the whole thing.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But <b title='just want to let you know'>just so you know</b>... <b title='↗whatever, whoever'>however</b> and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

<i>Phoebe</i>It-it's in the cake, isn't it?<br>
<i>Mike</i>(puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!<br>
<i>Mike</i>No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I-I wanna spend the rest of my life with you and-<br>

(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Phoebe, I...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Ready?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels <b title='in a manner that is appropriate for the purpose or situation'>properly</b>)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Ok. Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes!<br>
(Mike puts the ring on her finger)<br>
<i>Mike</i>I love you!<br>

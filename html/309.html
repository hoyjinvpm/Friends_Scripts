<i>Phoebe</i>You know, <b title='used when sth happens that does not usu happen'>for once</b>, I am <b title='going to'>gonna</b> sit down and try to watch one of these things. (Just as she sits down).<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='the intermission between halves in games of certain sports, such as basketball and football'>Halftime</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe a little three on three going?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! That would be sooo much fun!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Great, you can cover Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>! You never wanna do anything since you and Janice <b title='↗dump'>broke up</b>.<br>

All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you <b title='because'>'cause</b> the teams won't be even. Come on.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, all right, I'll play. But I don't like....you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yay!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Let's do it! Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wanna play football?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Says who? Your mom?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>"What do you mean," she asks her boyfriend, really <b title='↗frightened, alarmed, terrified'>scared</b> to hear the answer.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, every-every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a <b title='a variant of American football [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_football_%28American%29">Wiki</a>]'>touch football</b> game called the '<b title='The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL).

<i>Chandler</i>No, no, no, you say that proudly.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind of competitive and one year, Geller Bowl Six, I <b title='↗happen to, mean to, on purpose'>accidentally</b> broke Ross's nose.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to <b title='touch sb you are chasing in a game'>tag</b> her, so she threw her big-fat-grandma-arm <b title='↗joint, arthritis, knee, wrist, forearm, upper arm'>elbow</b> on my face... just keep running.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, to score the winning <b title="an act of moving the ball across the opposing team's goal line in American football">touchdown</b>, by the way.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't <b title='be allowed or accepted'>count</b>, because of the <b title='extremely'>spectacularly</b> illegal, oh and by the way <b title='very violent or cruel ↗vicious, malicious'>savage</b> nose breaking.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah! Then <b title='why'>how come</b> you didn't get the Geller Cup?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Um, there was a Geller Cup?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, it was the <b title='a large silver cup or similar object given as a prize to the winner of a competition ↗medal'>trophy</b> you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game,' and he <b title='be sick (and tired) of (doing) sth - be angry or bored with sth that has been happening for a long time ↗fed up'>was sick of</b> our fighting, so he took the trophy and... (Pauses to <b title='make an effort to remain calm ↗recollect'>collect himself</b>, as he <b title='be at the point where sth is about to happen'>is on the verge of</b> tears saying this) threw it in the lake.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football again.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Can I see you for a second?<br>
(They walk over to the <b title='↗basin, faucet, tap'>sink</b> and discuss it for a moment)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Shouting) <b title='sb who you think is weak or lacks courage'>Wuss</b>!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, we're gonna play.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
<s>The Park, the gang is <b title='↗work out'>warming up</b> for their football game.</s>

<i>Joey</i>Pheebs, <b title='here you are'>here you go</b>. (Throws her the ball)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Wait, no, honey, honey, throw it to me, throw it to me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Here you go. (Throws her the ball)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, we have to pick captains.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And then <b title='Captain & Tennille are American recording artists whose primary success occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_%26_Tennille">Wiki</a>]'>Tennilles</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so how do we decide that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, why don't we just bunny up.<br>
<i>Rachel, Chandler, and Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica and Ross</i>(Holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, looks like Ross and I are captains.<br>
<i>Joey</i>There must be a special place in heaven for people who <b title='hang out - hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hung out</b> with you two in high school.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so, I bunnied first which means I <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> pick first. Joey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, I'm your best friend.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe.<br>
(Phoebe kisses Rachel on the cheek, then joins her team.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sweetie, now I pick you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the light <b title='↗pole, rod'>post</b>.

<i>Phoebe</i>Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, you know what you're doing right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, all right, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna <b title='stop a ball etc from getting to where your opponent wants it to'>block</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's block?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I thought you meant in life.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Break.<br>
(Chandler is getting ready to kick off, Ross is holding the ball between his foot and finger.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (Goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross's foot instead.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>Come on</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry. I'm sorry. You know what, we're just gonna throw it.<br>
(Chandler throws the ball to kick off.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I got it. (Catches the ball)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Go! Go! Go!<br>
(Joey runs up field and <b title='fake - pretend to move in one direction, but then move in another, esp when playing sport'>fakes</b> out Ross and scores a touchdown. His team all celebrates the touchdown.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Score!! <b title='Score the game by adding six points for every touchdown and one point for every conversion. Conversions are played as a regular play where the offensive team tries to score in the end zone.'>7</b> to nothing!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Ok honey, just so that I'm clear on this: Now you said in the huddle that if Joey caught the ball you were gonna be the one to stop him. Now you didn't, so is that like a, like a football strategy?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, it was part of my plan to fall instantly behind. So, come on, let's go.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Losers, walk!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, losers talk!<br>

(Just as he gets in front of Margha, Monica comes up and <b title='tackle - force sb to the ground so that they stop running, in a game such as American football'>tackles</b> him)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! <b title='used to say that you are fairly sure that sth is true'>Bet ya</b> don't see that everyday, do ya?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! I just touched him and he went over.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, you wanna play <b title='not gentle'>rough</b>, we can play rough.<br>
(They both stare each other down as we hear 'Let's get ready to r-r-r-rum-ble!!!') (Michael Buffer (born November 2, 1944) is an American professional ring announcer for boxing and professional wrestling matches. He is known for his trademarked catchphrase, "Let's get ready to <b title='fight'>rumble</b>)<br>
(A long football sequence follows.)<br>
[Sequence 1: Monica throws the ball over Chandler's head to Joey who catches it for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. Chandler then tackles him, and he starts to dance in celebration.]<br>
[Sequence 2: Monica runs upfield and stops, waiting for a pass. Ross runs over and pulls her pants down, steps in front of her and <b title='intercept - stop and catch sb/sth before they are able to reach a particular place'>intercepts</b> the pass.]<br>
[Sequence 3: Chandler throws a pass to Ross, who catches it. Phoebe starts screaming and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around his waist and screaming.]<br>
[Sequence 4: Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera <b title="pan - move">pans</b> down to show Rachel standing deep in the end zone, playing with her <b title='chewing gum [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum">Wiki</a>]'>gum</b>. Something hits her on the head and she looks up to see where it came from.]<br>
[Sequence 5: Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a <b title='[<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Forearm%20Shiver">link</a>]'>forearm shiver</b> to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I love this game!!<br>
[Cut to Ross who walks up to Rachel who is eating a baked <b title='a baked snack <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/BrezelnSalz02.JPG/250px-BrezelnSalz02.JPG"> <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Partybrezeln.JPG/200px-Partybrezeln.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel">Wiki</a>]'>pretzel</b>.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, where'd you get that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I went really long.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's no surprise that you're winning 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.<br>
(Ross makes a 'Yeah. Right.' sound.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, what a great argument, <b title='exhale - breathe air, smoke etc out of your mouth ↗inhale, gasp'>exhaling</b>! All right, you know what, I'll prove it to you, ok. I'll <b title='exchange'>trade</b> you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh that's great. There goes my last <b title='a small thin piece that is torn or cut roughly from sth'>shred</b> of <b title='belief and confidence in your own ability and value ↗self-respect, ego'>self-esteem</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! Wh? The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, then <b title='bring it on - an invitation to fight'>bring it on</b>! Oh, unless of course you're afraid you might lose to <b title='a (large) number of'>a bunch of</b> girls.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine, fine, Rachel you're with Monica, Joey, you're with me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can not believe your trading me!! (Turns around and starts pointing at the guys) You are gonna lose. And you are gonna ...lose...and...(To Monica and Phoebe) Come on <b title='help out - help'>help me out</b> here. I've never done this before.<br>
<i>Pheobe</i>That's good - lose.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to the guys)....Lose!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are you gonna let me play?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right then.<br>
[Cut to the guys' team.]<br>
<i>Margha</i>(Coming over) The game is over, we eat now?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, Chandler finds me so <b title='making sb feel worried and not confident ↗intimate'>intimidating</b> that it's better if we're on the same team.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right. Ok, let's play. Let's go.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No ah, hold on a Saint Joe, where do Dutch people come from?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah well, the ah, <b title='refers to a cultural group formed by early German-Speaking immigrants to Pennsylvania, and their descendants.

<i>Chandler</i>And the uh, other Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the <b title='British and American people often call the country Holland, but this is not officially correct because Holland is only one part of the Netherlands. People from the Netherlands are called Dutch. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Wiki</a>]'>Netherlands</b>, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say sb has not been successful in doing sth, esp in persuading you or tricking you'>Nice try</b>. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this <b title='when you imagine or pretend that sth is real or true ↗pretend, fake'>make-believe</b> place where <b title='Peter Pan is a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J.

<i>Ross</i>(Quietly) Look, <b title='used when you are going to say sth that is honest but may sound rude ↗get sth straight, put sb straight, no offence'>let me put it this way</b>: If we lose, they will never let us forget it, ok? And worse than that they'll never let the women you date forget it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey! Are we playing football or what? Come on you <b title="Mary is a girl's name; hairy-backed - having hairy (a hairy person or animal has a lot of hair on their body) back">hairy-backed Marries</b>.<br>
[Cut to the girls huddle.]<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but they're boys, you know how are we gonna beat three boys?<br>
(Another football sequence follows)<br>
[Sequence 1: Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe <b title="flash - expose an inappropriate part of one's body.">flashes</b> him, he stops and stares <b title='so surprised that you do not know what to do or say ↗stunned'>dumbfounded</b> at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.]<br>
[Sequence 2: Phoebe throws the ball, and it's intercepted by Joey, who starts to run upfield. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she doesn't slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]<br>
[Sequence 3: Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]<br>
[Cut to the girls huddle]<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, we still have a minute and a half <b title='remaining'>to go</b>, and we're down by two points, ok? Two points... (She gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_five">Wiki</a>]'>high five</b>.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, there's a reason.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>God, I'm not <b title='unable to walk properly ↗limp'>lame</b>, ok. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right Rachel, you <b title='form a long curved shape'>sweep</b> behind, I'll <b title='aim and throw a ball'>pitch</b> it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. Thank you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. Break. Break!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!<br>
(Phoebe snaps the ball to Monica, who pitches back to Rachel.)<br>
<i>The Guys</i>One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!<br>
(There's a screen <b title='the view of sth in a film or TV program'>shot</b> of Rachel <b title='freak out - become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaking out</b> as the boys rush towards her. She panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm so sorry! Are you ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! I'm not ok!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Sorry, they were just all coming at me, I didn't know what to do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Goes up to Monica and starts doing a little <b title='words or phrases that are repeated again and again'>chant</b> and dance) You-are-the-loser. Dah-dah, dah, dah-dah-dah. (Monica is disgusted with it while Rachel thinks he is being ridiculous.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, ok, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on the verge of tears) Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Break!<br>
(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see the ball flying through the air, <b title='used to say what happens next'>and then</b> <b title='↗heaving beasts'>Rachel running underneath it</b>, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the <b title='a smooth way of moving'>grace</b> of <b title='a retired American football wide receiver [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rice">Wiki</a>]'>Jerry Rice</b> (no offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and <b title='spike - powerfully throw an American football down on the ground to celebrate a touchdown'>spikes</b> the ball. Both Phoebe and Monica <b title='suddenly start ↗active/dormant/extinct volcano'>erupt in</b> celebration.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey-hey you know, Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so, we win!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes-yes-yes.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.<br>
(They all start to <b title='move quickly ↗swoop, swipe, rush'>dive</b> for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='stop holding sth'>Let go</b>! Let go!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler!

<i>Chandler</i>Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='used to avoid saying shit ↗heck, hell, freaking, fucking, flinging-flanging'>shoot</b>! I work Monday nights.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh. The <b title='a mixture of bread or rice, onion etc that you put inside a chicken, pepper etc before cooking it'>stuffing</b> is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?<br>
<i>Joey</i>When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.

<i>Monica</i>Let go!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! You let go!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No!<br>

<i>Monica</i>I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.<br>
(It starts snowing.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! It's starting to snow.<br>
(They both look up, and watch it start to snow. Then they both start fighting for the ball again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="'give me'">Gimme</b> this!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Come on!
<s>Monica and Ross are walking in a <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>. Monica's nose is all <b title='stuff - fill sth until it is full ↗mucus, snot, bogey, bogie'>stuffed</b> up; Ross looks tired and is carrying the Geller Cup.</s>
<i>Monica</i>You know there was a time tonight that I started losing the feeling in my toes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's when I realized there's more important things than beating you at football. Things like feet.<br>
(They walk into the garbage room..)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I know. This thing has caused us too much <b title='↗agony, torture, torment'>pain and suffering</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>

<i>Monica</i>We'll just call it a tie.<br>

<i>Monica</i>All right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
(Ross opens the trash <b title='a long narrow structure that slopes down ↗shaft'>chute</b> for Monica. Monica puts the Geller Cup in it and Ross closes it. Monica pats Ross on the chest.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Good night! (leaves)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Good night<br>
(After she has seen Ross has left she goes back into the garbage room and opens the trash chute.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Pheebs.... did you get it?<br>

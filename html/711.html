<s>Chandler and Monica's, Chandler is sitting at the kitchen table eating cheesecake. The box it came in is also on the table.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ohh. Mmm.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you know I'm not that much of a <b title='sb who has a sweet tooth likes to eat sweet food ↗fondness, craving, longing'>sweet tooth</b>. I- (Chandler puts a <b title='↗handful, spoonful'>forkful</b> of the cheesecake in her mouth.) Wow. My God, so <b title='thick and smooth like cream ↗-y - like or typical of sth'>creamy</b>. Oh, my God, this is the best cheesecake I've ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>Gasping</b>) Thief.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I- no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. You can't return a box after you've opened the box.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why, why not?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because it's too delicious.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No-no-no! It is going to be ok, because Mrs. Braverman is <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='write to sb and ask them to send you sth by post/mail'>send away</b> for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake <b title='a large company formed by joining together different firms ↗monopoly, syndicate'>conglomerate</b>, (Reading the label) Momma's Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, I'm a <b title='very bad'>horrible</b>, horrible, horrible person.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(taking a bite) Well, I'm sorry, what?
<s>Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>, everyone except Rachel is there as Joey gets up and starts putting on his coat.</s>
<i>Joey</i>All right, I should get going, big day at work. You know I'm in a <b title='a deep unconscious state ↗pass out, vegetable'>coma</b>? Today, they do this test on me and it <b title='turn out - prove to be, end up'>turns out</b> I'm not brain dead.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah-ah-ah Mr. <b title='=smart alec - sb who tries to appear clever or who answers questions in a clever way that annoys other people'>Smarty-pants</b>, it's just my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, you still <b title='be scheduled or planned'>on</b> for tonight?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Absolutely!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, I'll see you at eight.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (Joey exits.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, what's at eight?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='in the proper or expected way'>duly</b> noted.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a <b title='another drink of the same type. re + fill'>refill</b>.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow, do you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> rent a car and drive down together or what?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What are you talking about?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Cousin Frannie's wedding, it's tomorrow night.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You were invited?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie<b title='has'>'s</b> made some new friends.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you wanna make some new friends?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well aw aw, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl ok? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, well you call her and tell her that you know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, ok? And if I hadn't stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go to.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She tried to undress me too.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then <b title='shush - used to tell sb to be quiet'>shushes</b> him.)

<i>Rachel</i>Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(reading the note) "Pheebs, can't <b title='be able to go to an event, meeting etc that has been arranged'>make it</b>, got a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh that's a <b title='an informal name'>nickname</b> we were trying out.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why don't you guys <b title='try ↗help out - help'>try out</b> "Francis"? (Turns to Ross): "Francis" is a cooler name than "Chandler" isn't it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know what nickname never <b title='catch on - become popular and fashionable'>caught on</b>? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in <b title="strong feeling of disapproval and dislike at a situation or sb's behavior etc">disgust</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So what?! That doesn't give you the right to <b title='leave behind ↗skip, blow off'>ditch</b> me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's what I hear. I've never <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> a chance to actually <b title='use ↗apply'>employ</b> the rule.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I don't accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to <b title='arrive at the place where sb is waiting for you'>show up</b>. Ok, I can't just be a way to <b title='spend time doing a particular activity while you are waiting for sth'>kill time</b> <b title='=til, until'>'til</b> you meet someone better!

<i>Joey</i>Wow! So sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, it does.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, can I-can I <b title='do sth good for you after you have been upset or disappointed'>make it up to you</b>? Huh? I'm sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you <b title='wear sb down - make sb weaker or less determined'>wore me down</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?<br>
<i>Joey</i>The Ross- Is that back?! (Chandler motions no.) {<a href="323.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/323.html">323 - Ross's Thing</a>: Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! You know, they'll call it, the Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."}
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is opening another cheesecake box.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Ahh...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The other cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't seem to say goodbye.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well I've forgotten what it tastes like, ok?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It was cheesecake. It was <b title='in small grains, pieces, or drops'>fine</b>. It had a buttery, <b title='breaking easily into small pieces ↗crumb, crumble, crumple'>crumbly</b>, <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Graham-Cracker-Stack.jpg/250px-Graham-Cracker-Stack.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_cracker">Wiki</a>]'>graham cracker</b> <b title='the hard outer portion or surface area of bread ↗dough'>crust</b>, with a very rich <b title='used to introduce a fact, situation, or quality that is surprising after what you have just said'>yet</b> light, cream cheese <b title='food put inside a sandwich, cake, pie etc ↗stuffing'>filling</b>... (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with <b title='the liquid that is produced in your mouth that helps you to swallow food ↗drool'>saliva</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(closing the box) You know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just <b title='not completely in control of your thoughts or movements ↗dizzy, faint'>light-headed</b>! So, let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and <b title='according to what you have heard or read ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b> it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Limited seating?! (<b title='↗squeak, shriek, squeal, scream'>Screechingly</b>) I am just one tiny person!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you, you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into <b title='small dry pieces of wood, etc used to start a fire ↗kindle'>kindling</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='very annoyed or upset'>disgusted</b>) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a <b title='weak and difficult to believe'>lame</b> excuse! That's not the reason why she's not inviting me!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>What's the big deal</b>?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the <b title='a large formal party'>reception</b>. And-and you know what?

<i>Ross</i>Yeah, Joan Tedeski, my <b title='sb who you have a romantic relationship with'>date</b>. She's an assistant professor in the <b title='the scientific study of language'>Linguistics</b> department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, uh, excuse me, I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> have to interrupt <b title="on sb's behalf - for/because of sb">on Ross's behalf</b>. I-I think the rule <b title='↗employ'>applies</b> here. You know, since she has a chance to <b title='make out with, have sex with'>get on</b> broad back...<br>

<i>Monica</i>Wait a minute, you know, you're bringing me!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? I can't cancel on Joan!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why not?!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='because'>Bec-</b> Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, ok? They're <b title='behaving in an uncontrolled, sometimes violent way'>wild</b>! Why-why do you wanna come anyway?<br>
<i>Monica</i>'Cause! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! <b title='a group of people who are related to each other'>Family</b>, you know-know? That's-that's important to me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan. (Does so.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>So <b title='according to the way sb looks or a situation appears'>apparently</b> we just don't pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(gasps) It's still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='before or not later than a particular time'>By</b> then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, that could kill her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, we don't want that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, so we're protecting her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well we should take it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but we should move quick.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they <b title='leave'>take off</b> upstairs.)

There's <b title='prime - of the very best quality or kind [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rib">Wiki</a>] <img src="300px-BeefCutRib.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/BeefCutRib.svg/300px-BeefCutRib.svg.png"> ↗fillet'>prime rib</b>, <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Coryphaena_hippurus.png/220px-Coryphaena_hippurus.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahi_mahi">Wiki</a>]'>mahi mahi</b>, and a very special <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster">Wiki</a>]'>lobster</b> <b title='a traditional type of Italian filled pasta [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravioli">Wiki</a>] <img src="140px-Ravioli_di_lattuga-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ravioli_di_lattuga.jpg/140px-Ravioli_di_lattuga.jpg">'>ravioli</b>. (She grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)<br>
<i>The Waiter</i>Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli. (Putting Joey's menu under his arm.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) You know what Pheebs?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You were right before. Friends are so important.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(checking her watch) Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know-you know what I really want?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Is to have a long, long talk. You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.<br>
<i>The Waiter</i>(returning) Any progress?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>God Joey, this is taking forever!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's the rush? What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>W-w- I just- it's that- I have- you know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa, what is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well... It's a date.<br>
<i>Joey</i>A date?! No, no, Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, I'm gonna! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That- It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Ok, he's very special to me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, well my girl from <b title='↗the other day - a few days ago'>the other night</b> was special. She was a scientist too!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She was?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, she graduated high school!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, whatever. You know what? I don't have time to <b title='↗talk into'>convince</b> you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him! (Gets up and leaves.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! (She exits.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to the waiter) What're you still doing here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
<s>Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is running up to meet David.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>David</i>Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I wouldn't miss this.<br>
<i>David</i>Well, I'm very glad you're here. (Kisses her hand.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you're such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We're going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is eating the cheesecake and Chandler enters and catches her in the act.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(with a <b title='↗handful, spoonful, forkful'>mouthful</b>) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little <b title='chuck - a thick solid piece ↗bit, crumb'>chunks</b> of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, what're you gonna do?! You're gonna go run tell Monica?! You're gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living <b title='↗outlaw'>outside the law</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm taking it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait a minute!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!<br>
[Cut to Chandler and Monica's as they enter.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yes! Oh yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well that's not fair, you've already had some!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? Oh, though not, you know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and <b title='soft and dry'>mealy</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What do we use to split it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(examining the cake) Ok. Well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. You know? So, maybe if I measured...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='used to show that you are angry or annoyed ↗for crying out loud'>for God's sake</b> just pick a piece!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, I'll pick that one. (Points.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Huh! So the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Ok, <b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb ↗here you go'>there you go</b>. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast. (As she's saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, <b title='stumble - hit your foot against sth while you are walking or running and almost fall ↗trip, stagger'>stumbles</b> and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='gloat - feel or express great pleasure or satisfaction'>gloatingly</b> and holding his piece) Ohhh!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> give me some of your piece.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b> and eat my... (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)
<s>Cousin Frannie's Wedding Reception, Monica and Ross are sitting at the table, alone as a woman approaches.</s>
<i>The Woman</i>Ross, sweetheart!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, hey Aunt Millie.<br>
<i>Aunt Millie</i>Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, yes it is. It's uh... (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!<br>
(Cousin Frannie and her husband enter.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me? (Starts to get up and greet Frannie.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can <b title='make a surprise attack on sb/sth from a hidden position ↗besiege, siege'>ambush</b> her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Frannie was the one who found your <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy">Wiki</a>]'>Playboys</b> and showed them to mom.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That <b title='an offensive way of referring to an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannie's shoulder.)<br>
<i>Frannie</i>(turning around) Monica! What...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What- Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I've possibly done?! (Frannie's husband walks up.) Stuart!<br>
<i>Frannie</i>I believe you know my husband.<br>
(Monica is shocked into silence.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So it's really a question of who could you have possibly <b title='do it - have sex'>done</b>.

<i>David</i>July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's really beautiful. What <b title='does'>'s</b> it mean?<br>
<i>David</i>Please, clean my <b title='beaker - a glass cup with straight sides and a pouring lip used in chemistry ↗test tube, flask'>beakers</b>. I don't get out of the lab much.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's good. I gotta admit, I thought it was something else.<br>
<i>David</i>Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I <b title='thought'>figured</b> I probably shouldn't, because you know, I... have to leave.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're right! You're right. Don't say it.<br>
<i>David</i>I-I do, though.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I do too. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>David</i>Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab <b title='↗pull away/in/over/up'>drives off</b>. Joey walks up and <b title='witness - see sth happen because you are there when it happens'>witnesses</b> that event.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(seeing him) Ok, now's not the time, Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just, you know, started thinking about you and David and I... remember how <b title='sad'>bummed</b> you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh, Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you ok?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No I'm not ok. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has, gone to Minsk and I may never... I may never see him again. (Crying.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you know you could always visit him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Anything I can do? Whatever you need.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well- But- <b title='used when pausing when you are thinking what to say next'>Now</b>, if-if you could achieve <b title='positron - an very small piece of matter with a positive electrical charge, having the same mass as an electron'>positronic</b> <b title='the evaporation and subsequent collection of a liquid by condensation as a means of purification'>distillation</b> of <b title='sub- - part of a bigger whole'>sub-atomic</b> particles you know before he does, then he can come back.

<i>Chandler</i><b title='keep, do not change'>Stick to</b> your side!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, <b title='used to express frustration'>come on now</b>!<br>
(Joey finishes climbing the stairs and sees them. Chandler and Rachel both stop and look up at him. Joey sits down on the step.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Did you see the way Stuart was staring at me? I think he still wants me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Just go do it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)<br>
<i>Aunt Millie</i>Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well...<br>
<i>Aunt Millie</i>Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!<br>
(Ross hesitates then leans down trying to get her to kiss his cheek, but she moves his head around and kisses him on the lips again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica's wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie <b title='very shocked or upset'>stunned</b>.)<br>

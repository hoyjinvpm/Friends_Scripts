<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I don't know why we don't <b title='spend a lot of time in a particular place or with particular people'>hang out</b> with married couples more often.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ok. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a <b title='↗itchy, sting, sore, swelling'>scratchy</b> throat for no reason.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe it's because you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe. So this is the uh living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No it's not!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='squint - close your eyes slightly and try to see sth'>squinting</b> his eyes) Are you kidding? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>When your head was <b title='hang out - lean out of a window so that the top part of your body is outside'>hanging out</b> the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title="↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">glares</b> at him for a moment, then admits <b title='unwillingly ↗reluctantly'>grudgingly</b>) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or-or any other house for that matter.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, ok? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmm...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, we know that's you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, hmmm, it's not. Hmmm...

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.<br>
<i>Mike</i>That's great! You changed you name?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! (She <b title='↗grin, smirk'>smiles from ear to ear</b>)<br>
<i>Mike</i>(afraid) You're kidding right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='No'>Nope</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>You really did that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='Yes'>Yep</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah, but you-you can't do that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why? Why? It's fun, it's different, no one else has a name like it.<br>
<i>Mike</i>(looks at her <b title='↗astounded, amazed'>astonished</b>) <b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, then I'm gonna change my name.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Great, ok, what're you gonna change it to?<br>
<i>Mike</i><b title='solid waste that has left your body, rubbish'>Crap</b> Bag.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?<br>
<i>Mike</i>No, no Mike, just-just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're not serious, right?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah, I'm serious. (<b title='criticizing sb/sth in an amusing way'>sarcastic</b>) It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like that!<br>

<i>Mike</i>I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And I love Crap.

(A young girl enters)<br>
<i>Girl</i>Who're you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who're you?<br>
<i>Girl</i>I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(understanding) Oh.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>(sighs) I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> my parents.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a <b title='agreement ↗deal'>pact</b>) Alright, look. There's-there's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(thinking) Uhm... oh! Ok. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is <b title='lived in or visited by a ghost'>haunted</b>!<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>What're you? Eight?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Woah, uh! Ok, let's hear your great idea.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='feeling annoyed, upset, and impatient, because you cannot control or change a situation, or achieve sth ↗desperate'>frustrated</b>) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>I really don't.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm <b title='fixed'>set</b> in my ways.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>This is what my mom was talking about. <b title='The people who complain only leave room for more whining.'>Whiners are wieners</b>. (Joey glares at her angrily) Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah, I guess. Yeah.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe.<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>Then you gotta <b title='let go - stop holding'>let them go</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(In <b title='↗verge, brink'>near</b> tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're, you're probably right. How did you <b title='be able to'>get to</b> be so smart?<br>
<i>Mackenzie</i>I read a lot.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)<br>
<i>Man</i>You still don't know my name, do you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)<br>
(In the meantime, Ross is trying to squeeze and push a rather large chair through the revolving doors of the Ralph Lauren building.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(annoyed) Ross, what's taking you so long?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed.

<i>Mark</i>How've you been?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm <b title='extraordinarily (extremely) good'>fantastic</b>. You remember Ross?<br>
<i>Mark</i>Sure, sure. (To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so- (laughs stupidly)<br>
<i>Mark</i><b title='↗briliant, smart'>Clever</b>. (back to Rachel) So-so how're you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day.<br>
<i>Mark</i>Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big <b title='↗raise'>promotion</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and some charity work.<br>
<i>Mark</i>Are you sure? because we may have something at <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton">Wiki</a>]'>Louis Vuitton</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ugh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Ok, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then <b title='behaving in a calm manner ↗casual, breezy'>nonchalantly</b> walks away)

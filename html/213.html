<i>Van Damme</i>You can tell her I think her friend is cute. (Rachel pushes him)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.<br>
<i>Susie</i>OK, well then who was the kid that got caught <b title='masturbate - give yourself or another person sexual pleasure by touching or rubbing the sexual organs ↗touch oneself'>masturbating</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>OK that's not what he was doing. All right, he was looking for his bus money.<br>

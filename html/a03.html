<s>Joey and Rachel's apartment.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Chandler, why do you think they call it <b title='table football'>foosball</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what I like about you, Joe? <br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're curious.<br>
(Rachel and Emma come out.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi. I'll <b title='drop off - take sb somewhere'>drop Emma off</b> at my mom's if we're still <b title='in a condition of being scheduled for or decided upon'>on</b> for tonight.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh <b title='used to emphasize that you agree with sb or are eager to do what they suggest'>you bet</b>, yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (to Emma) say "bye."<br>
<i>Chandler and Joey</i>Bye.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Yeah, it's actually our first <b title='formal'>official</b> <b title='romantic meeting ↗ask out, go out'>date</b>. <br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='No ↗nope, not really, no way, not so much'>Nah</b>, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What must be like not to be <b title='cripple - cause serious damage to sb/sth ↗lame, limp'>crippled</b> by fear and <b title='loathe - dislike sb/sth very much ↗hate'>self-loathing</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(pause) It's OK!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How can you be so <b title='↗insecure'>confident</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I... I know exactly what I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> do!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? Like you have a <b title='the usual order in which you do things, or the things you regularly do'>routine</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no no no no. See, each woman is different. You have to, <b title='↗realize, recognize'>appreciate</b> their uniqueness.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly <b title='touch sth lightly while passing it'>graze</b> her <b title='the top part of your leg, above your knee ↗shin, calf, groin, crotch, loins'>thigh</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)<br>
<i>Joey</i>NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I <b title='understand'>see</b> what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarrassed)<br>
<i>Joey</i>More foosball?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>and beer!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.

<i>Ross and Chandler</i>Hey!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop <b title="↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">staring</b> at your sister's legs!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so <b title='having darker skin after spending time in the sun =tanned'>tan</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She went on one of those spray-on tan places.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That was supposed to be a secret!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did I say spray-on tan places? I meant <b title='ride on waves in the ocean'>surf</b> <b title='↗rival, contestant, competitor'>contest</b>, which she won.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You, you got a spray-on tan?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler gets <b title='a treatment for your feet and toenails that makes them look and feel good ↗manicure'>pedicures</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughing) Wh-what you do, like with the-the toe separators?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Why...why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, do you get colors or just <b title='<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD/2wBDACodICUgGiolIiUvLSoyP2lEPzo6P4FcYUxpmYagnpaGk5GovfLNqLPltZGT0v/V5fr/////o8v///////L/////2wBDAS0vLz83P3xERHz/rpOu////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////wAARCABsAGIDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHwAAAQUBAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFBgcICQoL/8QAtRAAAgEDAwIEAwUFBAQAAAF9AQIDAAQRBRIhMUEGE1FhByJxFDKBkaEII0KxwRVS0fAkM2JyggkKFhcYGRolJicoKSo0NTY3ODk6Q0RFRkdISUpTVFVWV1hZWmNkZWZnaGlqc3R1dnd4eXqDhIWGh4iJipKTlJWWl5iZmqKjpKWmp6ipqrKztLW2t7i5usLDxMXGx8jJytLT1NXW19jZ2uHi4+Tl5ufo6erx8vP09fb3+Pn6/8QAHwEAAwEBAQEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAECAwQFBgcICQoL/8QAtREAAgECBAQDBAcFBAQAAQJ3AAECAxEEBSExBhJBUQdhcRMiMoEIFEKRobHBCSMzUvAVYnLRChYkNOEl8RcYGRomJygpKjU2Nzg5OkNERUZHSElKU1RVVldYWVpjZGVmZ2hpanN0dXZ3eHl6goOEhYaHiImKkpOUlZaXmJmaoqOkpaanqKmqsrO0tba3uLm6wsPExcbHyMnK0tPU1dbX2Nna4uPk5ebn6Onq8vP09fb3+Pn6/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDM3Cl3CoyCDgjBooAkyPWnVDRQBNQFycAZNNjR3OFB+tX4bfy1yeWNJsaQ2GAJyR81W0j7mnIgUfN1p461O5olYAtLilPAoJ4pAQuKrvxVlyAKoTyelAgMi56iiq2B6UVVibmpPbpKuCOexrKmiaJyrfgfWt4rVa5gWVcMKSdhtXMdUZzhQSfarcVl3kPPoKuQxKqYUACpMc07gokccYUYAwKkjUsWYdFpxGBUlkyyQMg6gnNJajegJGWNKwC//WpGJUlTxTMk/SgoC2aaz4FQzXKRnAyzf3V5qMRzXHMn7tP7o6mkA2acudsYLH2pYrUEZk+Zv0FWooVRcKMCpQtAiDyvc0VZxRQA8ionFTimEZyaYkVgCrZ6f1p3vUjL6io2UjpQUB5GKplpbWffGfqOxq4pBGaUqCORSArNqEknDRL+FIDPOQp+RO+OtWQqg5AFSxx5jMh7jgU9xXSIo4o4hhV5p2Caeq087VHHJosAxFOR704jFRs1BfjrSESUVFvooHYeklOPqKy47rB+arkUwYcHimOxaUhuDTXTFR55yDU0YLrkninuLbUgVCXO36mirJKQjk8n8zVcnJzSaBO5HIcLmpLCYSwmMn5k4x7U0jIIqlIksMu+IkH1FCYNXRovlDg/hTPmPPaqYvjx5qkn1FK91LKMRRke7UDLDsqjk/iaqyXca8Alj7U0WckpzLITU8dnGnRfzpCKv2qX/nkaK0fJX0ooApzWvdarfPGeCRWoSM4pjRo/UUDKa3cq9gaGuZn4zj6VZ+yJ1yakSGNO1MLkNujk7nJJ96tAYFBwCKXIxSEIKD83A6U1mCoTnpU0W37MMdccmmkJshEcQ52ZPrSlPQYFTAoOppC6jpRYdxqg07FM8wdKDIKQD6KZvFFAhmAaUKDSDrUijFAwCil2gUtJmmAwjmlCinEUUgIJk+RgKbZXCAGOTOe1TMMtzVWa13HcnBpoNy0Rlvk6e5pCqj7zEn0HSqY+0r8o5+tL5Ur/AOsdvoBRcZM8kaDkgfjVaS6T+HJpxtVxwCT71D9gkJ5cAe1GgmH2s+n60Uf2c3/PQflRRoK7NJetSU0dKcKQxaSg0UAHakpaKAGt1BoUB5AhOM56USfdqJWK3cWO+RTAsGIhjszgUhU9zSOxEjAHvSFj60wQoSl20Ixpc0hCbRRS0UgP/9k=">'>French tips</b>?<br>

(Phoebe enters)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Pheebs!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Who's Amanda?<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she <b title='pick up - get/catch an illness etc'>picked up</b> this fake British accent. On the <b title='answering machine'>machine</b> this is her message. (she <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mimic, mock, simulate'>apes</b> Amanda using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you trying to do a British accent?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Just let me know'>Just so I know</b>, how many more of those can I expect?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a British accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, and she's always <b title='brag - speak too proudly about what you have done or what you own =boast ↗bluff, smug, gloat, strut'>bragging</b> about all the famous people she's met.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I know! "Uh...I slept with <b title='an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Joel">Wiki</a>]'>Billy Joel</b>". All right, who hasn't?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ugh, Let's just cut her out!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and <b title='avoid'>dodge</b> her <b title='=till, until'>'til</b> she <b title='get - understand'>gets</b> the <b title='idea/meaning'>point</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so <b title='strict, unkind'>harsh</b>! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, had it done to me though. Feels good!
<s>At the tanning <b title='a shop where you can get your hair washed, cut, curled etc ↗parlor'>salon</b>. Ross and a male assistant are walking through a <b title='corridor'>hall</b>.</s>
<i>Assistant</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b> Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three. <br>
<i>Ross</i>Well... I, I like how you look, what're you?<br>
<i>Assistant</i><b title='sb who was born in Puerto Rico [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico">Wiki</a>]'>Puerto Rican</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Two, I think a two.<br>
<i>Assistant</i>You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. <b title='You understand'>You got it</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.<br>
<i>Assistant</i>Wow, you <b title='understand'>catch on</b> quick.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I have a <b title='Doctor of Philosophy - a university degree of a very high level'>PhD</b>, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement)<br>
(Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning <b title='a small partly enclosed place ↗phone booth, stall, cubicle'>booth</b>. He stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and <b title="the main part of a person's or animal's body, not including the head, arms, or legs">torso</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You sprayed my front, twice!<br>
<i>Assistant</i>You never turned?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I barely even got to three Mississippi. <br>
<i>Assistant</i>Mississippi? I said count to five!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='-less - without'>Mississippilesly</b>? (pause) Well, how bad is it?<br>
<i>Assistant</i><b title='am/are/is/have/has not'>Ain't</b> that bad <b title='used in negative statements and questions to talk about whether sth that was expected has happened'>yet</b>, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, how dark is it gonna get?<br>
<i>Assistant</i>Oh, you got sprayed with two twos and...<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm a four?<br>
<i>Assistant</i>Yeah, but your back's a zero. You're gonna wanna <b title='if things even out, or you even them out, they show fewer or smaller changes or differences'>even that out</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sarcastically) Really?!<br>
<i>Assistant</i>You might wanna get back in there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗upset, irritated'>annoyed</b>) Ok!<br>
(The assistant leaves and Ross goes back in the spray-on tan booth and turns his back to the spray <b title='nozzle - a narrow part at the end of a tube through which a liquid flows ↗spout, sprout, hose'>nozzles</b>, facing the back wall)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!<br>
<i>Assistant</i>You got two more twos?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(hysterically) I'm an eight!
<s>Joey's apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Thanks for dinner. <br>
<i>Joey</i>I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems <b title='↗confused, bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>puzzled</b>) Ha, guess we won't be going back there!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
(Joey and Rachel start kissing)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey what do you say, we uh move this onto <b title='sb/sth similar to'>the likes of</b> the couch?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I say '<b title='cheap and not of good quality'>cheesy</b> <b title='words'>line</b>', but ok.<br>
(They move on the couch and start kissing again. Joey does his grazing on Rachel's thigh and she slaps his hand)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What's the matter?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, sorry.<br>
(They start kissing again and, when Joey grazes her thigh, she slaps him on his hand again)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I am sorry! Again, I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't <b title='understand'>get</b> it, Chandler loved it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
(They start kissing again and when Joey grazes, she slaps him three times, on the hand, and on both cheeks)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(a little <b title='dizzy'>giddy</b>) Uh, was that good for you?
<s>Monica's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are reading magazines when the phone rings and Phoebe reaches to pick it up.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(to Phoebe) No, no, don't get it. Let the machine <b title='"lift up" (the phone)'>pick up</b>. <br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could <b title='take care of children'>babysit</b> again.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It could be Amanda!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, you're right! Oh, I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is <b title='sth that is fun and makes you laugh a lot'>a gas</b>!<br>
(The machine picks up the phone)<br>
<i>Amanda</i>Hello Monica. It's Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can <b title='go somewhere quickly, suddenly, or in a way that you did not expect'>pop by</b> your <b title='apartment'>flat</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're from <b title='the fourth most populous city in the U.S. state of New York [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkers">Wiki</a>]'>Yonkers</b>! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!<br>
<i>Amanda</i>Let's see.. to assure you get this directly, <b title='call, phone'>ring</b> me back on my mobile.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, don't <b title='thy - an old word meaning you (mocking her English accent). not to hold your breath - used to say that you do not expect sth to happen'>hold thy breath</b>!<br>
(Sound of dialing numbers is heard from the speaker of the machine)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello? Is someone on the line?<br>
<i>Amanda</i>Yes, I-I was looking for Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='Wait'>Hang on</b>, she's <b title='exactly'>right</b> here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Amanda) I get pedicures.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi Amanda! Uh... Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe <b title='mouth - move your lips in the same way you do when you are saying words, but without making any sound'>mouths</b> 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why, why, why didn't you just say no?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I said 'no' to her <b title='come over - visit ↗come by, drop by, stop by'>coming over</b> now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(leaving) Fine, fine! You would not <b title='=hold (keep, not change)'>hold up</b> well under <b title='an act of deliberately hurting sb in order to force them to tell you sth or to punish them ↗torment, anguish, agony'>torture</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>And you would?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I did!
<s>Joey's apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting on the couch.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Uh Rach, are you sure you wanna do this? <br>
<i>Rachel</i>Absolutely! Absolutely. I'd... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Ok, well, uh, how, how can we make it easier?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, let's work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, got it, yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel and Joey</i>Ok.<br>
(They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely)<br>
<i>Joey</i>This thing <b title='weld - join metals by melting their edges and pressing them together when they are hot ↗fusion'>welded</b> <b title='closed'>shut</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. You want, you want a little help?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No no, I can handle it ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I've been opening these since I was 9. <br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nine? What kind of a 9-years-old girl wears a bra? <br>
<i>Joey</i>No no no. I was 9. See, she was 16. Ok? Yeah. My parents had, had... I can't talk and work at the same time! All right, turn around, I gotta get a look at this thing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ow!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sorry!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well this is romantic!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it <b title='pop - move quickly, make sudden noise'>popped</b> open! I blame your bra!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's a <b title='the common or usual type of that thing'>standard-issue</b> bra <b title='a metal object used to fasten a piece of jewelry, bag, belt etc'>clasp</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You <b title='throw off - distract, divert, or mislead'>threw me off</b> with all your slapping!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but, do you think that maybe on-on some level, you-you, you don't wanna take off my bra?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='contemplate - think very carefully about sth for a long time ↗mediate, meditate'>contemplates</b> for a few moments what Rachel just said) Nah! I don't have another level!

<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh dear God.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hold on! There is something different.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Was that place... The Sun?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his <b title='↗stomach, abdomen, belly button'>belly</b> is very tanned and his back is very pale.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>How could you <b title='mess up - damage, spoil'>mess this up</b>? It's so easy! You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looks at her <b title='↗quizzical, dubious, doubtful, questionable'>suspiciously</b>) How do you count to five?<br>
<i>Monica</i>One Two Three...<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Yells) Damn it! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)<br>

(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in this face and front again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>OH! <b title='used when you are annoyed or surprised'>SON OF A BITCH</b>!<br>
(He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you kidding?<br>
<i>Glenda</i>How did we do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm a <b title="Shouldn't it be 16?">twelve</b>.
<s>Joey and Rachel's.</s>
(Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other) <br>
<i>Rachel</i>What is the matter with us?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I know what's <b title='penis down'>the matter</b> with me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know.<br>
(Chandler enters the apartment)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That fake British woman is a real <b title='an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>, but she sure can dance... Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first <b title='hook up - start having a sexual relationship with sb'>hooked up</b>, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Kinda... you know, <b title='sneak - go secretly ↗stealth, sneaker'>sneaking</b> around, having to hide from you guys...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I-I, was there a part of you that...that felt like it was... really wrong?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Actually no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this <b title='continuously or very often ↗all the time'>the whole time</b>.<br>
(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get to them)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can tell from your expressions that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Right, totally.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... <b title='have sex'>do it</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's a... pla-an.<br>
(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(sighs) Wow... I did not <b title='see it coming - see that sth is likely to happen, esp sth bad'>see this coming</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't, I don't <b title='understand'>get</b> it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted. <br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hmmm... Me too...<br>
(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='Why'>How come</b> Monica and Chandler could do it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.<br>
(Rachel lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aah... <b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> you're right.<br>
(They look at each other for a while)<br>
<i>Joey</i>So...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I love <b title='you'>ya</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, me too.<br>
(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.<br>
(Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on his <b title='painful and uncomfortable'>sore</b> spot)
<s>Ross's apartment.</s>
(Ross is reading a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_%28magazine%29">Wiki</a>]'>National Geographic</b> on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.) <br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to address sb ↗fella, buddy, man, pal'>Dude</b>, it's Chandler. Let me in.<br>
(Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Go away! I don't wanna see anybody.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really? Did you count Mississipily?<br>
(Ross walks to the door and opens it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You, you're not tanned.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I just had to get a picture of this.<br>
(Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll see you later!<br>
(Ross closes the door)<br>

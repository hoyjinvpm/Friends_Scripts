<i>Rachel</i>Damn!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! You ready to go?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, listen, how cold is it gonna be there? Do I need a coat or will all these <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater_vest">Wiki</a>]'>sweater vests</b> be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)<br>
(Monica stares at him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you.<br>
(There's another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. After she says the <b title='words than an actor say in a play etc'>line</b> and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded <b title='carelessly'>sloppily</b>, unlike before. Hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! You know? I'm gonna miss him!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='↗sarcastic'>Thanks a lot</b>! I just got that <b title='sb, esp a man, who is stupid or who does things that annoy or hurt other people'>jerk</b> out of my mind!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, so where're we staying? Is the movie <b title='put sb up - let sb stay in your house and give them meals'>putting us up</b> in a big hotel <b title='a set of rooms'>suite</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh no, <b title="used to say 'no' or 'not' in a less strong way ↗no way, nope, nah">not really</b>. It's an <b title='a feature film that is produced mostly or completely outside of the major film studio system [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film">Wiki</a>]'>independent film</b> you know? So we don't have a real big budget. I <b title='thought'>figured</b> I'd just stay in your room.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be <b title='spring for - pay for'>springing for</b> a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah! Check this out. For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Did you not hear the <b title='the story of a book, film, play, etc'>plot</b> of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just wanna say goodbye to you guys, and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='you will get what you want'>You got it</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right!<br>
(Joey nods to Chandler, <b title='used to emphasize that you will not agree or be able to do sth'>no way</b>!)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(stares at Joey) You remember the number, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah black 13.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Black 15!!!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You got it. (shakes his head "No Way" again)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, bye-bye now!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Bye!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye you guys!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Bye-bye!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I wanna say goodbye at the car!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Anybody wanna say goodbye to me at the car?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, honey, I'll say goodbye to you at the car if you don't mind the <b title='a thick yellowish liquid produced in an infected part of your body (for her eye) ↗snot, mucus, bogie, bogey'>pus</b>.<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>See you! (Walks out.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, wait a minute! A little pus is good! It means it's <b title='↗cure'>healing</b>! (Runs after him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Pheebs, <b title='what are ya (you)'>whatcha</b> reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pheebs, are you, are you mad at me, or something? <b title='because'>'Cause</b> if you are, please, tell me what it is I did!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if you don't know I can't help you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I don't know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I can't help you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, whatever it is, I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Ok?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Apology accepted.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. So we're, <b title='Is everything ok, settled between us?'>we're good?</b><br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, ok?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(quietly) Bye, fat ass.<br>
<i>Ross</i>ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know! I don't remember!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! What do you mean-what do you mean you can't remember?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I was so focused on being mad at you that I forgot what it was I was mad about!<br>
<i>Ross</i>If you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that <b title='used to indicate the great intensity, extent, or degree of sth such as an action, feeling, or change ↗Thank you very much'>much</b>. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. 'Cause You actually have a very <b title='good, excellent'>sweet</b> little <b title='buttocks [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinie">Wiki</a>]'>heinie</b>.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn <b title='if a car horn or a goose honks, it makes a loud noise'>honks</b> and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I guess I just need lunch.<br>

And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and, I, don't know what happened there either...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, was it awful?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, it was loong. I didn't even realize how late it was, till I <b title='↗spot'>noticed</b> the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn't wanna stay. I called a cab; she just left.<br>
(They kiss.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I wrote you a letter.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Handing him the letter) There's just, some things I've been thinking about, you know, things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I'd better <b title='start doing sth or going somewhere quickly ↗kick off'>get cracking</b> on this baby.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh. (Looks at his watch) Oh-oh-oh-oh. (Takes a <b title='↗sip, gulp, gobble, swig, down'>drink</b> of coffee and resumes reading the letter)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Done!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You just finished?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So umm, does it?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='↗sure, what, excuse, what'>I'm sorry</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Does it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, you know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, I don't. <b title='actually'>in fact</b>, I've decided, I have decided that, that it.......does.<br>
(Rachel stands there for a moment, starting to cry. Then <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly in a way that can be heard ↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b> and runs over and hugs him. While hugging her, Ross tries to find the 'Does it?' part in the letter.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are you sure?<br>

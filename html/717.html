<i>A Woman</i>Here he comes! Hurry!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Rachel) Hey! Don't be a baby!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well I...<br>

<i>A Woman</i>Let's go!<br>

[Time lapse, inside the store, Monica is <b title='frantic - done quickly and with a lot of activity, but in a way that is not very well organized ↗hysterically'>frantically</b> looking for her dress.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. No. Not it. Not it. Ugh. (Checks another <b title='a piece of equipment, usu made of metal or wooden bars, that is used for holding things or for hanging things on'>rack</b> and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don't <b title='stand very close to sb so that they feel uncomfortable or nervous'>crowd</b> me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and <b title='tug - pull sth hard ↗yank, jerk, tuck'>tugs</b> on it.) I'm sorry, this one's taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Megan!<br>

<i>Monica</i>You came!<br>
<i>Megan</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is my dress!<br>
<i>Megan</i>No!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!<br>
<i>Megan</i>And now you'll see me buying it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? You <b title='sb who is strange or different ↗weirdo, creep, psychic, jerk'>freak</b>! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!<br>
<i>Megan</i>Look, you don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> fight me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe I do! I'm pretty <b title='strong, determined and not afraid of arguing with people ↗tough'>feisty</b>! (She blows the signal.)<br>
[Cut to Phoebe in another part of the store.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(hearing the signal) I'm coming! I'm coming! (She <b title='take off - leave'>takes off</b> towards the signal and almost <b title='↗bump/run into'>knocks another woman over</b>.)<br>
<i>Woman</i>Hey!<br>
(She hears another signal in another direction.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel <b title='curl - form a curved or round shape'>curled up</b> in a <b title='of, relating to, characteristic of, or being a fetus (a young human or animal before it is born) ↗egg, sperm, semen, embryo'>fetal</b> position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What're you doing? (Rachel doesn't stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won't stop so Phoebe <b title='pinch - squeeze between the thumb and a finger'>pinches</b> her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Did you find the dress?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> get me out of here Phoebe! These <b title='a thing bought for less than the usual price ↗haggle, cheesy'>bargain</b> shoppers are crazy!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I-We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>(handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(seeing who's trapped) Hey...<br>
<i>Monica</i>GO! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
<s>Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>So, Ross, how was your <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> <b title='the other day - a few days ago'>the other night</b>? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet">Wiki</a>]'>toilet</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to <b title='↗ask out'>go out</b> again.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Huh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her <b title='at the present time/immediately'>right now</b>. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says... (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey, Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Listen, sorry I didn't <b title='make a short visit to some place ↗come by'>stop by</b> last night but I had a date.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Oh, great! We're going out again Saturday. But, I just found she's also <b title='see - have a romantic relationship with'>seeing</b> some other guy.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying things that are opposite of what you mean'>sarcastically</b> shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I <b title='sort of'>sorta</b> am. I mean yeah, I'm <b title='date - have a romantic relationship with'>dating</b> this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not too worried about it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well you shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't wanna be the guy who's <b title='being considered, running as a candidate'>up</b> against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that <b title='a stupid person ↗dork, bonehead, idiot, moron, imbecile, retarded'>doofus</b> is going to lose!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?<br>
<i>Joey and Ross</i>Kristen Lang.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Well now let's-let's look at this <b title='≠subjective'>objectively</b>, I think I should date her...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(not <b title='buy - believe/accept'>buying</b> it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok. This can go on for a while.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah well we should order some food then.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, Joey! Look, why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Ok? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smiling) That sounds fair.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah hey-wait a second now! Look, we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a <b title='fashionable and expensive'>fancy</b> place like that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, sorry, that's what I do on dates.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So let's decide on the spending limit...<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah but the Swing Kings? You know they <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>suck</b> so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, what is the other reason?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't wanna say.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was... the first time I knew that... you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh <b title='rubbish ↗defecate, feces, dropping, dung, manure, poo, poop, pee, urinate, urine, number 2'>crap</b>!

<i>Joey</i>A woman in a man's body.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Much better.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So, you know Ross it's funny 'cause you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?<br>

<i>Kristen</i>Yeah, little Eric.<br>

<i>Joey</i>So you've just been married the one time then?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, umm...<br>
<i>Kristen</i>You've been married twice?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes. And another time after that. <b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b> I'm getting <b title='↗starving'>hungry</b>! Hey, Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?<br>

<i>Joey</i>(laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying or changing the subject">now</b>-why did that first marriage break up? Hmm? Was it because the woman was <b title='≠gay ↗heterosexual, homosexual'>straight</b> or because she was a lesbian?<br>
<i>Kristen</i>Do you two know each other?<br>
<i>Joey and Ross</i>No. No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. It just seems like Ross is the <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> guy who would marry a woman <b title='very near to the moment when sb does sth or sth happens'>on the verge of</b> being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.<br>
(Kristen is not enjoying this.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute! Were you on a <b title='a large printed notice or picture, used to advertise sth or as a decoration'>poster</b> for <b title='a disease affecting the sex organs that is passed on by sexual contact ↗VD (venereal disease), diarrhoea, ED - Erectile dysfunction'>gonorrhea</b>?<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ok look, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, believe it or not, it's true. I mean when Joey and I were together, he was wonderful.

<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What're you talking about? Sarah's great!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a <b title='a scene in a movie, play, book etc that shows sth that happened before that point in the story ↗slow motion'>flashback</b> video) We're <b title=' if people get along, they like each other and are friendly to each other'>getting along</b>, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, <b title='happening or appearing suddenly and without warning ↗out of blue'>out of nowhere</b>...<br>
(Sarah picks up some <b title='French fries'>fries</b> from Joey's plate and Joey looks very angry. Then we're back to Central Perk and Joey does a you-see-what-I-mean look to Phoebe)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's it? That, that's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, <b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>big deal</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>ALL FOOD!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, I, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a <b title='A garden salad (also green salad or tossed salad) is a salad consisting mostly of fresh vegetables.'>garden salad</b> and then eat my food!

(Rachel enters from the main door)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Rachel) Oh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thank God you're here. Listen to this!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So Joey and my friend were out last night, they're having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries-<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='↗inhale, exhale'>gasps</b>) Oh, no!<br>
(Joey looks satisfied)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? You, you know about the, the plate thing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just, just last week we were having breakfast and he-he had a couple of grapes on his plate-<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Joey) You wouldn't let her have a grape?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no! Not me! Emma!<br>
(Phoebe looks horrified and she turns to watch Joey)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! Ok? And if-if you need to, then just get an extra plate of fries for the table!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing <b title='sth that protects another thing by being between it and sth else that could harm it'>buffer</b>! Yeah, yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah, yeah. And a <b title='a dish that consists of shrimp, salad, and a sauce'>shrimp cocktail</b>. And some <b title='Buffalo chicken wing [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_wing">Wiki</a>]'>Buffalo wings</b>. Maybe, maybe an individual pizza, uh?

(Rachel arrives with a lot of clothes)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ah, this place is great!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! Ok, you guys have fun, (in a strange voice) I'm gonna go talk to people in this voice.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, I'm not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair!

(Rachel <b title='heave a sigh - breathe in and then breathe out noisily and slowly once'>heaves a long disappointing sigh</b>).<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is <b title='unusual'>out there</b>, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). <b title='<a href="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/Reports/PDF/0069.PDF">How much does Ross earn?</a>'>Three hundred and fifty dollars</b>?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Both logic and math are <b title='take a hit - inhale through the nose (do drugs)'>taking a serious hit</b> today.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
(Ross wears the jackets and look at himself in the mirror)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Actually this, this looks like pretty good! Yeah! (he turns and watches his back and there's a sign on the back of the jacket, "boys will be boys") <b title='sth that you say which means it is not surprising when boys or men behave in a noisy, rude, or unpleasant way'>Boys will be boys</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? They will be!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, <b title='used when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>, I'm getting out of here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No no no! Ross, wait! Come on! All right, you know what, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these, these nice pants...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, actually these-these might look <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> good on me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm-I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go <b title='crazy'>nuts</b> for you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into <b title='her pants'>hers</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
<s>The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought "who better than a minister to raise a child?"<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='a word used to end a prayer; used to show that you agree with a suggestion or remark'>Amen</b>.<br>
<i>Erica</i><b title='used to add more information ↗besides'>Plus</b> I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible say anything about adoption?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It says "Do it!" And <b title='see / look at '>behold</b> she did adopt <b title='to'>unto</b> them a baby. And it was good. {Luke 1:31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.}<br>
<i>Erica</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, wow.<br>
<i>Erica</i>I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your <b title="a priest's flock is the group of people who regularly attend his or her church">flock</b>?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>People in your church.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, my flock! Oh no no, my flock, my flock is good, Yeah, my flock <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> takes care of themselves by this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.<br>
<i>Erica</i>(to Chandler) Being a doctor, that must <b title='fill a particular amount of space or time'>take up</b> a lot of time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not for me it doesn't.<br>
(The agency guy enters the room)<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>So, how's everything <b title='go - happen, develop'>going</b> in here?<br>
<i>Erica</i>We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>Good. Well, do you have any question for Erica?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>Oh, yes, our system assures total <b title='when other people do not know who you are or what your name is'>anonymity</b>. We're very proud of it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You should be. You're really <b title='up-to-date on sth, knowing about the current state of sth'>on top of</b> stuff.<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>(to Erica) Well, then, if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Actually, I don't think we have to.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You don't?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but, I just thought we should meet <b title='↗in person'>face to face</b>. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks <b title='confused and not certain what to do ↗confused, puzzled, bemused, perplexed'>bewildered</b>). Did you hear that?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>You've got to stop!<br>
<i>Monica</i>But she liked us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a reverend. I mean, as, as a chef, I serve God, by feeding the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Your <b title='the meat of a calf (a young cow)'>veal</b> <b title='a small piece of meat with a bone in it'>chop</b> is $34.95!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel ok about this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know..<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh, honey..<br>

<i>Sarah</i>Oh, that is so <b title='kind, gentle, and friendly'>sweet</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) ok.. (she takes her hand back)<br>
(Then she reaches over again and Joey moves his plate a little to the left, and she misses, then she reaches out again, and he moves his plate to the right , so she misses again. She tries a third time and this time, Joey pushes his plate so far to the left, it drops off the edge of the table)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!<br>
<i>Sarah</i>What? what is the matter with you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't like it when people take food off my plate, ok?<br>
<i>Sarah</i>But you just said "What's mine is yours"?<br>
<i>Joey</i>WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!<br>
<i>Sarah</i>Fine, sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Ok, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, ok, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, <b title='scrape - remove sth from a surface (floor in this case)'>scrapes</b> the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you know, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).<br>
(Sarah looks a little <b title='very annoyed or upset by sth that is not acceptable'>disgusted</b>)
<s>Ross and his <b title='sb who you have a date (romantic meeting) with'>date</b> walk into a <b title='the area just inside the entrance to a hotel, restaurant etc'>lobby</b>. They are both wearing their jackets.</s>
<i>Girl</i>Wow, this place looks great.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.<br>
<i>Girl</i>Me too! (starts to take her coat off)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They <b title='suddenly'>abruptly</b> put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and <b title='go in particular direction'>head</b> into opposite directions)
<s>Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands.</s>
<i>Joey</i>I really am sorry about, you know..<b title='adv at an earlier time'>before</b>. I just want to make sure you know that I really <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> like you.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.<br>
(The waiter arrives with their deserts)<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Chocolate <b title='a large cake filled with a mixture of cream, chocolate, fruit etc'>torte</b> for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red <b title='sth that is very bad or is of bad quality, rubbish; solid waste that is passed from your bowels'>crap</b> on my cheesecake.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Oh, yes, that's <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Raspberries05.jpg/220px-Raspberries05.jpg">'>raspberry</b> <b title='a thin fruit sauce'>coulis</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Coulis is not a monkey? When I read the description I thought it came with a little raspberry monkey.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>(tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, I'll just have what she's having instead.<br>
<i>Waiter</i>Oh, I'm sorry, sir. That was our last piece.<br>
<i>Sarah</i>Mmmm! Mmm!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy. (pushes it aside)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.<br>
(Sarah's beeper starts bleeping)<br>
<i>Sarah</i>Oh, no! This is work. I should <b title='telephone the place where you work'>call in</b>. Can you <b title='give sb permission to leave a place'>excuse</b> me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh yeah, sure. No problem.<br>
(Joey's looking at Sarah's dessert, and takes her plate.)<br>
<i>Sarah</i>What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coulis?<br>
<i>Sarah</i>(laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a <b title='a reciprocal (given and received in return; mutual) situation'>two-way street</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughing) Really?<br>
<i>Sarah</i>Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs <b title='uneasy - not comfortable, peaceful, or relaxed'>uneasily</b> and Sarah leaves the room)<br>
(Joey sits <b title='with one side facing forward'>sideways</b> on his chair, looking at Sarah's chocolate torte, and then looking away from it, nervously playing with his fork, <b title='drum - make a sound similar to a drum by hitting a surface again and again'>drumming</b> with it on the table <b title='sometimes but not often ↗(every) once in a while, from time to time, occasionaly'>every now and then</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to the torte) Stop staring at me!<br>
(He then straightens himself, and looks at the torte)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why, just a tiny little...<br>
(He takes a little piece of Sarah's dessert. At first he doesn't think it's that special, but then...)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh-oh!<br>
(Time <b title='pass'>lapse</b>)<br>
(Sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees her dessert is missing. Joey has emptied her plate, and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm not even <b title='If you are sorry about a situation, you feel regret, sadness, or disappointment about it.'>sorry</b>.
<s>The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.</s>
<i>Erica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Adoption Agency guy</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>So, these are the <b title='coming before the main or most important part of sth'>preliminary</b> forms for an <b title="a form of adoption in which the biological and adoptive families have access to varying degrees of each other's personal information and have an option of contact [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_adoption'>Wiki</a>]">open adoption</b>. There's a lot to <b title='check sth carefully'>go over</b>, but I'll explain everything as we <b title='read, discuss'>go through</b> it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?<br>
<i>Erica</i>Yeah. It's a <b title='an image, esp of a baby that is still inside the womb, which is produced by ultrasound'>sonogram</b> they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, doctor!<br>
(Chandler takes Monica's hand, and gets serious) Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk...(pause) We're not who you think we are.<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>I don't understand.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.<br>
<i>Erica</i>What?<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>That's impossible.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.<br>
<i>Agency guy</i>Uh, I have to check your file. <b title='Excuse'>'scuse</b> me.<br>
<i>Erica</i>So who are you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would <b title='love, esp in a way that is not based on sex'>care for</b> this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)<br>
<i>Erica</i>So you lied to me <b title='adv at an earlier time'>before</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, we... (makes <b title='""'>quotation signs</b> in the air) "<b title='It&#039;s from the Bible. [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090519124644AAIHhN0">link</a>]'>bore false witness</b>"... See, I could be a reverend.<br>
<i>Erica</i>I can't believe this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...<br>
<i>Erica</i>Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...<br>
<i>Erica</i>I don't want to look at your file! This is over.<br>
(She leaves the room, but Chandler runs after her. They meet in the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Erica wait!<br>
<i>Erica</i>I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few <b title='pace - step'>paces</b>)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.<br>
<i>Erica</i>Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an <b title='extremely good'>incredible</b> woman. She's <b title='showing love'>loving</b> and <b title='giving sb/sth a lot of love and attention'>devoted</b> and <b title='kind, helpful, and sympathetic toward other people'>caring</b>. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It <b title='kill - make sb feel annoyed, sad, concerned etc'>kills</b> me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?<br>
(They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You still want that baby?<br>
(Monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to Chandler, who is <b title='twist - turn part of body'>twisting</b> with joy. They hug.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>God bless you Chandler Bing!
<s>Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.</s>
<i>Ross</i><b title='turn out - end up, prove to be'>Turns out</b> this <b title='a piece of warm wool or cotton clothing with long sleeves'>sweater</b> is made for a woman.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(nods) So, why are you still wearing it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ooh... Not so good.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.<br>
(They shake hands the way friends would. There's a <b title='a small sweet cake that often contains fruit'>muffin</b> on the table, and Ross breaks off a piece and wants to put it in his mouth.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!<br>
(Ross puts the piece back on the plate)<br>

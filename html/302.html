<i>Joey</i>Relax, Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, you know, I'd feel <b title='used for emphasizing what you are saying'>a whole lot</b> better if you got dressed now.<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say that you do not think sth is as important as sb else thinks it is'>What's the big deal</b>, sit somewhere else.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom). So...<br>
<i>Ross</i>You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big <b title='any of the tubes carrying blood from all parts of the body to the heart ↗artery'>vein</b> in my head <b title='pop - come out/off'>pops</b>. So..<br>

<i>Monica</i>Well, who's voice was that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I-I cannot remember her.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Great, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easier to get a cab.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It was Michelle.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It was definitely Michelle.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, Pheebs, you go with Monica and <b title='↗put on, take off'>try on</b> her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, God, what was I wearing?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well you don't, you don't know what you're wearing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your <b title='important'>big</b> night.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ross, that's a towel!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, you'll notice that I am fully dressed. I, <b title='as a result of sth'>in turn</b>, have noticed that you are not.

<i>Chandler</i>The cushions are the <b title='the most basic and important quality ↗essence oil'>essence</b> of the chair!<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's right! I'm taking the essence.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh-ho, he'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He took my essence!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, now <b title='wait'>hold on</b>. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?<br>
<i>Joey</i>'Cause I'm not wearing any underwear now.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, uh, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>What, what are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, opposite, is opposite! (Leaves)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's got nothing!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Ok, I'm ready.<br>
<i>Ross and Chandler</i>Oh, aaaah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are you supporting?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Yeahh, but, but those really <b title='if colors, tastes, styles etc go, they look, taste etc good together'>go better with</b> pants. Maybe I should wear pants?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better <b title='used for emphais'>yet</b>, um, how about you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your <b title='↗arse, ass, bottom, buttock, tush, tushy, tushie'>butt</b> in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, ok? No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your <b title='earlobe - the soft round part at the bottom of the ear'>earlobes</b> look fat. Ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But I...<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, no just do it. Go in there, pick something out, so we can go.<br>

<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (Listens)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, you're so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. I know. Well, you know how it is, it's just I-I...<br>

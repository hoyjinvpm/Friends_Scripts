<i>Ross</i>(in the meanwhile) There're people out there, please just keep quiet.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake, right?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>In a foreign, romantic country...<br>
<i>Monica</i>I blame London.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Bad London! (Takes a spoon and <b title='↗spank, slap'>smacks</b> the turkey.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Only here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Mon, honey, I <b title='have go to'>gotta</b> ask you something.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(impatiently) Now?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen, can I?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I-I don't know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, what should I do?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just <b title='going to'>gonna</b> talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.<br>
(Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?<br>
<i>Mr. Waltham</i>(Walking by) Yes.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, <b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">what's up</b>? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he's eating it with his hands.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='motion - make a signal to sb ↗signal, gesture'>motions</b> to himself and Mrs. Geller and <b title='grin - smile widely'>grins</b>) You and me, next dance?<br>

{(Cut to Rachel who is walking past Mrs. Waltham.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Waltham</i>Sweetheart, sweetheart...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Mrs. Waltham</i>You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left. (Points at the entrance.)<br>

(Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Forget it, that's <b title='cancelled'>off</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why?!<br>
<i>Mr. Waltham</i>(drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...<br>
(Joey walks up to them.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I <b title='thought'>figured</b> we're in another country, so it doesn't <b title='↗include, consider'>count</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's true.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>The man's got a <b title='a single fact, idea, or opinion that is part of an argument '>point</b>.<br>
(Cut to Rachel and Ross.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi. I'm sorry, things aren't <b title='work up - prove to be successful'>working out</b> so well.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh no! It could be better, oh, it's gonna be ok, right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna <b title='begin to feel better after a very upsetting experience'>get over</b> this, you know? I mean, so you said my name!

You know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why, Emily would think it meant something, you know, because-because it was you...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Right...<br>
<i>Ross</i>But it absolutely didn't. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn't! It didn't!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Approaching) Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='saying the opposite of what you really mean'>sarcastic</b>) Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You <b title='spit_spat/spit_spat/spit'>spit</b> on me man! (Wipes his face.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm-I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Laughs) You know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, right!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Get the hell out of there, you know?<br>
(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realise what she just said and run over to the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, look at that, same thing.
<s>London Marriott, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "<b title='used to express happiness, excitement or great satisfaction =hurray'>Yippee</b>!" just ignore me.<br>
(She laughs and opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on the bed.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, hello Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross said my name. Ok? My name.<br>
{<i>Monica</i>How did you get in here?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. Come on, you guys. Ross said my name up there, that obviously means that he still loves me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Monica) Your sister Joan is crazy.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(They both just stare at her.) You know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right. Do you guys wanna go downstairs and get a drink?}<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross said my name up there, that <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> means that he still loves me. Ok, don't believe me. I know I'm right. All right, you guys <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go downstairs and get a drink?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes, I wanna change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Elbows him) Fifteen minutes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It's Phoebe!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, hey hey hi there...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh great...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi, so what happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Ross said my name.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, Pheebs, you know what, let's look at this <b title='using facts and not influenced by personal feelings or beliefs ↗subjective'>objectively</b> all right? Ninth grade, right?

Right? So then...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?<br>
<i>Monica</i>My clothes are... ohh! (They both leave.)<br>
(Cut to Chandler's room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after seeing that he isn't, <b title='↗shove, escort'>ushers</b> Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow, you look...<br>
<i>Monica</i>No time for <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreplay">foreplay</a>]'>that</b>!<br>
(They both start to frantically rip each other's clothes off, but are interrupted when Joey tries to open the door.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, <b title='used to address sb'>dude</b>, let me in. I got a girl out here!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I've got a girl in here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, we're-we're <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b> in here!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I suppose I would have to say you! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's <b title='a 1998 comedy drama film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Giant">Wiki</a>] <img src="225px-My_giant_poster-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/My_giant_poster.jpg/225px-My_giant_poster.jpg">'>My Giant</b>!<br>

<i>Monica</i>You really think this is ok?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! You know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
(They both run to rip the <b title='↗comforter, duvet, quilt, bedclothes'>covers</b> off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering) Emily?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nope, not under here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You didn't find her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, I've looked everywhere!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I think you should keep looking!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, for about, 30 minutes?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Or 45.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at <b title='↗2 orgasms'>that</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>No! <b title="used to emphasize that you don't know">For all I know</b>, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No-no, <b title='↗as of, ever since'>from now on</b>, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) <b title='exactly'>Right</b> here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, it's getting late.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, we're gonna go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Actually, you guys mind staying here for a while?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ugh, you know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane to New York.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, it's a very large plane.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(disappointed) <b title='used to say that you agree with sth, that you understand it, or that it does not annoy you'>That's cool</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But, we'll stay here with you.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>We have to leave for New York in an hour.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>We can't do that, that's insane. I mean 'A', he could wake up, and 'B', you know, let's <b title='try to get ↗persue'>go for</b> it.<br>
(They both try to slowly <b title='remove sb from a place in which they are trapped ↗release, free, intricate'>extricate</b> themselves from Ross, but there's a knock on the door that awakens him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)<br>
<i>Mr. Waltham</i>No.<br>
<i>Mrs. Waltham</i>You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.<br>
<i>Mr. Waltham</i>We've come for her things.<br>

Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Ok? She's-she's just a friend, that's all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) Now, look, just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me, that you'll tell her that.<br>
<i>Mr. Waltham</i>All right, I'll tell her. (To his wife) Come on <b title='an insult'>buggerface</b>!<br>

(Monica gets up and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is <b title='startle - make sb suddenly surprised or slightly shocked'>startled</b> to see Joey sitting in Monica's seat.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Can I ask you something?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uhh, no.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant, right? And I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, you know, you think I'll ever get there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thanks man.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok man. (Chandler starts to get up.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>But what about how much taller he is than me?<br>
(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of <b title='alcoholic drink ↗virgin, spirit'>booze</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, you know? And who knows what science will <b title='think of an idea etc'>come up with</b> in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?<br>
(Monica returns.)<br>

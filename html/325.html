<i>Chandler</i>(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was, with a woman?!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Why is that so funny?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You made a joke right? So I laughed.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha. A little too hard. What am I, not ah, boyfriend material?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ohh-ha-ha-ha!<br>
<i>Bonnie</i>I think I brought back <b title='a lot of sand'>half of the beach</b> in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.<br>

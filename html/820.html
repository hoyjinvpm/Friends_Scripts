<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, what's the final <b title='the number of people ↗headhunt'>head count</b> on my baby shower?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>About twenty, a couple people from work without something else to do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Also both of your sisters called and neither can <b title='be able to be present at a particular event'>make it</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and no <b title='alcoholic drink ↗spirit, liquor'>booze</b>?! That's shocking! I don't care, <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> my mom's here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, your mother!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! My mom's not <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be here?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, <b title='because of, considering'>given</b> that we forgot to invite her it would be an <b title='very'>awfully</b> big coincidence if she was.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>My God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(interrupting her) Oh <b title='used for telling sb to stop saying or doing sth that is annoying you'>give it a rest</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No. (Pause) Neither is mine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, you know what? Don't worry, ok? We'll <b title='deal with'>take care of</b> it. We'll call her. You just go home and get ready.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Please, make sure she comes. That's really important to me, I mean that's my mom!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. I know, what's her number?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh, hello Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) Hi, umm I know this is <b title='the latest possible time for doing sth'>last minute</b>, but we-we've decided to <b title='organize'>throw</b> an <b title='done or said without earlier planning or preparation'>impromptu</b> baby shower for Rachel today.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>For what dear? For not inviting me or for lying about it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Phoebe) Oh my God, <b title='[<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2095192_reduce-sweaty-butt.html">Google Ad - How to Reduce Sweaty Butt</a>]'>my ass is sweating</b>! (On phone) I'm sorry for everything. Really! I mean... There's-there's, there's a lot of planning in a baby shower. I mean, you know, things get <b title='overlook - to not notice =miss ↗oversee'>overlooked</b> and... Phoebe's mother kills herself!<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Why? Did you forget to invite her too?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Laughs) You're so funny! Please! Please! Can-can you come? It starts at four o'clock.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Well all right. I'll see you at four.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you. (Hangs up.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Isn't it at three?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used when you are annoyed'>Son of a bitch</b>! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
<s>Joey's Apartment, Joey is reading a script as Ross and Chandler enter carrying a basketball.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey Joe! <b title='want to'>Wanna</b> shoot some <b title='the game of basketball'>hoops</b>? (To Ross) And <b title='sth that is meant to be known and remembered for future reference [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080219230729AAYFdDd">link</a>]'>for the record</b>, I'm not covering the tall one this time.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine. But she's <b title='fairly short'>not that tall</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b> to be the host of a new <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show">Wiki</a>]'>game show</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh cool!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's great.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah-yeah, and if I get it, by day I'll be Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be (In an <b title='↗newsreader'>announcer</b>'s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know, I know. And it would be so great if I got this, because you never know what could happen to you on a <b title='soap opera [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera">Wiki</a>]'>soap</b>, but I could be a game show host forever, like, that <b title='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker'>Bob Barker</b> guy. He's been doing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right">Wiki</a>]'>The Price Is Right</b> for 75 years!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to say you are sure about sth'>I bet</b> the ratings weren't good for the first 25, you know, before there was television.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, oh yeah. But the problem- this game is really complicated.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh <b title='used to encourage sb to do sth'>come on</b>. You said the same thing about "Hungry Hungry Hippos", and last week you <b title='beat - defeat. beat_beat_beaten'>beat</b> Ben.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I have to be honest with you guys. He <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> let me win. But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well do you want some help?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh really? That'd be great! Hey you guys can be the <b title='who takes part in a contest ↗competitor, assistant, protestant'>contestants</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='extremely good'>Awesome</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I guess we can lose to <b title='typically includes seventh and eighth grade [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_high#United_States">Wiki</a>]'>junior high</b> girls some other time.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(announcer voice) All right! Let's play <b title='bamboozle - cheat/mislead/confuse'>Bamboozle</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Bamboozle?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, isn't that a cool name?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='simultaneous - happening or being done at exactly the same time'>simultaneously</b> with Chandler) Yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(simultaneously with Ross) No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right. Uhh, ok. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well uh, I-I'm a <b title='paleontology - the study of fossils'>paleontologist</b>. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh...<br>
<i>Joey</i>I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg/85px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet">Wiki</a>]'>Soviet</b> scientists with <b title='not behaving in the usual or accepted way and often causing trouble ↗'>rogue</b> <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-world">Wiki</a>]'>third-world</b> nations. Hi <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin">Wiki</a>]'>Rasputin</b>! (Waves.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Excellent! Let's play Bamboozle! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of <b title='a country in northwestern South America. Not to be confused with Columbia. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia">Wiki</a>] '>Colombia</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogota">Wiki</a>]'>Bogotá</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a <b title='evil'>Wicked</b> <b title='get sth by tricking sb or persuading them in an indirect way'>Wangle</b> card.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What<b title='does'>'s</b> a Wicked Wangle card do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wangle card determines whether you go higher or lower.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Higher or lower than what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is embarrassing. (<b title='look sth up - try to find sth in a dictionary etc'>Looks it up</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) Can you believe how <b title='boring / of poor quality ↗dull'>lame</b> this is?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Rachel's baby shower is <b title='happening now'>underway</b>. Monica and Phoebe are working in the kitchen.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm so glad you could make it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Try. Oh there's my little girl. (Goes over to Rachel.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's still mad.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make <b title='conversation about unimportant things, often between people who do not know each other well'>small talk</b> with.<br>
<i>Guest</i>(To Phoebe) Hey, how are you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, uhuh, yeah, ok, ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, look, we've apologized twice! I-I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you know you just have to... be ok with it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. I can do that. (Pause) I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go <b title='put power on'>powder</b> my ass.<br>
[Cut to Rachel and Mrs. Green.]<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh <b title='used as an interjection'>my</b>, look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you <b title='pick - choose'>picked</b> your <b title="a woman whose job is to take care of a particular family's children / grandmother">nanny</b> yet? Now I don't want you to just use your <b title='sb whose job is to cook, clean, and look after a house for its owner ↗houseboy, butler, maid'>housekeeper</b> <b title='because'>'cause</b> it'd just split her focus.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh well actually I'm not gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>It's like you're a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how <b title='difficult to fight against ↗tough, tricky'>overwhelming</b> this is gonna be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. K.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Mrs. K! Oh that- she was <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, <b title='your mother is crazy'>tu madre es loca</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Such a sweet woman. And more important: She became a part of our family.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's right. Mrs. K. What did that K stand for?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>I have no idea dear, she was the nanny.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, as-<b title='though'>as</b> great she was, I-I can't afford that.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>(Laughs) I'm sorry, sometimes I forget not everyone has <b title='money that sb pays to support a husband or wife they are no longer married to ↗divorce'>alimony</b>. Oh, Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-wh-what? What?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes. Yes I do.
<s>Joey's Apartment, the guys are still playing Bamboozle.</s>
<i>Joey</i>All right Ross you're <b title='winning'>in the lead</b>, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of <b title='a very confused situation =chaos ↗chore, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_babel">Tower of Babel</a>]'>Mayhem</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, this is gonna be <b title='difficult'>tough</b>. Hold your breath.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's ok, I'm ready.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No <b title='used to address sb ↗man, pal, buddy, fella'>dude</b>, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question. It-it's part of the game.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his... (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this <b title='a strong unreasonable fear ↗hydrophobia, photophobia'>phobia</b>, Tris...<b title='an exclamation of surprise, delight, or dismay (unhappiness, disappointment)'>Holy cow</b>, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me see that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>This one <b title='exactly'>right</b> here. (Ross <b title='whine - make a long, high, sad sound ↗groan, moan'>whines</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Triscadecaphobia.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(exhaling) The fear of <b title='a snack cracker made by Nabisco <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Triscuit-Crackers.jpg/220px-Triscuit-Crackers.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triscuit">Wiki</a>]'>Triscuits</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No, fear of the number 13.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fear of Triscuits?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's possible, they've really sharp edges.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, Chandler, you're <b title='prepared, ready'>up</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm <b title='entitle - give sb the right to do sth'>entitled</b> to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes, yes. But you can only use it once, so choose wisely.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hmm, this is <b title='difficult to do'>tricky</b>. I mean, I-I am in the lead, but I, I would love another shot at the Golden Monkey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This game <b title='make sense - be reasonable/sensible'>makes no sense</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? You're just upset 'cause you're losing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I would like to <b title='keep'>hang on to</b> my Angel Pass, please.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="Ross keeps his Angel Pass, so it's Chandler's turn.">All right</b>. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me think. Let me think-Oh! Uh I don't care.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You-you must choose Mr. Bing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Either, it makes no difference.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Choose, you <b title='stupid person ↗dork, doofus, bonehead'>jackass</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll take a card.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, you picked the <b title='give me'>Gimme</b> card! You get all of Ross' <b title='point - a unit for counting the score in a game or sport'>points</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This game is kinda fun.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, the baby shower is continuing as Rachel walks over to Monica and Phoebe.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Monica) Do you wanna start opening presents, 'cause it seems like people are getting <b title='wanting to go somewhere new or do sth different ↗eager, longing, keen, urge, desire'>itchy</b> to leave. And when I say "people", I mean me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why did you invite my mother?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She wants to move in with me and Ross to help <b title='↗look after, bring up, raise'>take care of</b> the baby.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>For how long?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is <b title='needing a lot of effort =demanding'>taxing</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She can't hear you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? You guys, <b title='tell sb to hurry'>come on</b>! What am I gonna do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you do not want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (She goes over to tell her mother.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Phoebe) This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! You know what? And I'm just gonna <b title='arrive suddenly and do sth ↗dive, plunge, whip'>swoop</b> in there and be like the daughter she never had.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, honey. You have to <b title='let sth go - stop holding/thinking etc sth ↗take it easy'>let it go</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (Pause) Who doesn't accept an apology!? I mean, it's just so simple. "I'm sorry Sandra", "That's ok Monica. I forgive you. And by the way, you're very pretty."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I have new respect for Chandler. All right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the <b title='↗vip'>most important person</b> in this room. And in the world!<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How about you less important people, let's open your presents!<br>
<u></u>
(Mrs. Green goes into the kitchen and Rachel follows her.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Mom that's ok that you didn't get you a gift!<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Ok, you see mom, the truth is I can do this <b title='alone ↗by myself'>on my own</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Sweetheart I know you're gonna be a <b title='very good'>terrific</b> mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Really? Remember Twinkles?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>He was a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Cashew_sable_syrian_hamster.jpg/108px-Cashew_sable_syrian_hamster.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster">Wiki</a>]'>hamster</b>! I am not gonna <b title='clean using a vacuum cleaner'>vacuum</b> up my baby!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, come on Rach, it's present time! You know you're the glue holding this whole party together. It's kinda <b title='fall apart - break into pieces'>falling apart</b> here.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh look.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They came- this is from your friends at work.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my <b title='used to express surprise'>gosh</b>! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She's holding an item with a large <b title='the process of sucking air'>suction</b> cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.)

Is that a <b title='a device composed of a funnel attached to a tube used to facilitate the rapid consumption of beer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_bong">Wiki</a>]'>beer bong</b> for a baby?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Darling, that's a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_pump">Wiki</a>]'>breast pump</b>!<br>

<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh you're gonna do that ten times a day?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?! It <b title='go - happen'>goes</b> ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! <b title='↗racism, racial discrimination, prejudice, stereotype'>Indian food</b>?!<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>No, dear, that's what babies do.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? (Everyone <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>.) What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>You can't leave a baby alone!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh come-(<b title='stutter - speak or say sth, esp the first part of a word, with difficulty ↗stammer'>Stutters</b>)-Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe, you know, not as she would be with me, the baby <b title='stupid person'>dummy</b>. Oh God, ok. You know what? Opening the presents is a little <b title='overwhelm - cause sb to feel sudden strong emotion'>overwhelming</b> <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them all a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.<br>
<i>Woman</i>It's actually a <b title='a bed for a baby ↗crib, pushchair, stroller, cradle, playpen'>bassinet</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok mommy, don't ever leave me. (<b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>Hugs</b> her.)

<i>Chandler</i>Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozle!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Nooo!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is the best game ever!
<s>Monica and Chandler's, the baby shower has ended and everyone except for Mrs. Green have left who is talking to Rachel while Monica and Phoebe are cleaning up.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Of course I am!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh mom, I swear I'm not an <b title='↗imbecile, moron, retarded'>idiot</b>. I read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I <b title='vomit ↗retch, gag, puke, sick, nauseous'>throw up</b> in my diaper genie?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Nooo. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine. (Starts to get up.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait-wait where're you going? Where're you going?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>I'm going to the <b title="↗restroom, men's room, ladies' room">bathroom</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i><b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying or changing the subject">Now</b> don't worry! Everything's gonna be ok. (Hugs Rachel while she is standing and Rachel is sitting, seeing this Monica decides to join in on the hugging by hugging Mrs. Green from behind her back.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>It is gonna be ok! (Mrs. Green <b title='glance - look quickly'>glances</b> over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the bathroom.) Worth a <b title='attempt'>shot</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering, out of breath) Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! Why are you all red and <b title='covered in sweat ↗-y'>sweaty</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just Bamboozle Chandler! (<b title='flex - bend an arm, leg etc, tighten a muscle'>Flexes</b> in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not a sexual thing. That was a quick <b title='baby shower'>shower</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Not if you were here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow! Looks like we got a lot of good <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(excited) A <b title='a modeling compound used by young children for art and craft projects [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-Doh">Wiki</a>] ↗dough'>Play-Doh</b> <b title="a shop where men's hair is cut ↗salon, hairdresser's">barbershop</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn't happy.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is <b title='used to tell sb that sth is impossible'>no way</b> we can take eight weeks of her. She'll <b title='make sb in a bad state'>drive</b> us totally crazy.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>(entering from bathroom) Hi Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi <b title='=roommate ↗classmate, playmade, teammate'>roomie</b>! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
<s>Joey's Audition, Joey is being shown in.</s>
<i>Man</i>Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(announcer voice) It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.<br>
<i>Ray</i>Yeah. And this is Duncan (points to the cameraman) and Erin, they're gonna <b title='help out - help'>help us out</b>with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(announcer voice) <b title='Irish Slang for agreement'>Righty-O</b> Ray!<br>
<i>Ray</i>Whenever you're ready.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to the camera) Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozle! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?<br>
<i>Erin</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky">Wiki</a>]'>Wayne Gretzky</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wangle card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?<br>
<i>Ray</i>Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the <b title='revise - change, improve, or make additions ↗devise, improvise, review'>revised</b> rules? We've <b title='eliminate - remove / take away ↗erase'>eliminated</b> all that. No wheel, no cards.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why-why?!<br>
<i>Ray</i>Uh, well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't <b title='understand sth difficult ↗get, see'>follow</b> it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you <b title='suddenly pull sth quickly and with force ↗jerk'>yank</b> his tail and <b title='↗bam'>boom</b>! You're in Paradise Pond!<br>
<i>Ray</i>Yeah all that's gone. Um, it's basically just a simple question and answer game now.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?<br>
<i>Ray</i>Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(announcer voice to the camera) Let's play Bamboozle!
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Mrs. Green is telling Ross what needs to be done to <b title='↗bulletproof, fireproof, foolproof, soundproof, waterproof'>baby proof</b> his apartment.</s>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>So, I thought we'd put the changing station in the living room. And I thought I'd <b title='ask sb to become involved'>bring in</b> my <b title='sb whose job is to paint houses and put paper on the walls ↗interior designer'>decorator</b>, because you know, I really feel like I'm at my best when I'm surrounded by <b title='tone - a color, or a particular shade (type) of a color [<a href="http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-jewel-tones.htm">link</a>]'>jewel tones</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sure, who-who doesn't?<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh, and all those dinosaur <b title='knick-knack - a small ornament (a small beautiful object) of minor value ↗cheesy'>knick-knacks</b> you have, Ross, I-I thought they might be more <b title='feel comfortable/happy etc. (They belong there)'>at home</b> in the garage.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well we...we don't have a garage.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Did I say garage? I meant garbage.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what? Mrs. Green, Maybe it's not absolutely <b title='very important/necessary/essential ↗fatal'>vital</b> let you live with us.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>What- Rachel needs help with the baby.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I do. I really do. I don't know anything.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'm-I'm sure that's not true.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, not a thing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's frightening.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well uh, you know what? Even-even if she doesn't know anything, I do! And I'll be there to-to show her, so...<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>That's exactly what Rachel's father told me. But you know what he said at the first 3 A.M. feeding? "I'm tired, you take care of it." Which I later said to him when he wanted to have sex.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, Um I'm not Rachel's dad. And <b title='used for telling sb that you hope that what you are saying will not offend them'>no offense</b>, but he's an <b title='fool, idiot, anything unpleasant'>ass</b>.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>I <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> like you Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>That's true. You do have another child.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>With another woman. Have you no control Ross?<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's a different <b title='problem'>issue</b>. Uh, the <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b> is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and <b title='wash sb in a bath ↗bathtub'>bathe</b> her and <b title='change her diaper'>change her</b>. And more than that I want to do all those things.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Well then you really don't need me to live with you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed.<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>You're gonna be a great father.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you- you're gonna <b title='pick sth up - learn sth by watching or listening to other people ↗learning curve'>pick it up</b>. (Rachel doesn't believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look, you know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I hope you're <b title='go - continue talking'>going</b> somewhere with this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look at you! What-You're-you're this big <b title='a senior manager in a business or other organization ↗CEO (Chief Executive Officer)'>executive</b>! You are much more capable than you give yourself <b title='praise'>credit</b> for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an <b title='extremely good =unbelievable'>incredible</b> mother.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. (Hugs him.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>All right you two, I'm gonna get going.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay <b title='fixed, staionary'>put</b>. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) You're still so funny. You're so funny. (To Phoebe) What do I do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, <b title='although'>albeit</b> slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what? You're-you're right.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah I mean if you wanna say anything to her, I'd <b title='If you tell sb off, you speak to them angrily or seriously because they have done sth wrong ↗scold, retort, talk back'>tell her off</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the <b title='corridor'>hall</b> with Phoebe <b title='If you go somewhere with sb in tow, they are with you'>in tow</b>.) It is rude to leave a party without saying goodbye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the <b title='socially acceptable / good'>decent</b> thing to do is to accept it! 'Cause what I did to you, it wasn't <b title='↗mean to, deliberate, accidental'>on purpose</b>! But what you're during to me now, it's just <b title='used for emphasis'>plain</b> <b title='deliberately trying to upset sb or cause problems for them =vicious ↗malicious'>spiteful</b>!<br>
<i>Mrs. Green</i>Spiteful?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Monica) <b title='wrap sth up - finish sth'>Wrap it up</b>, wrap it up, wrap it up...<br>
<i>Monica</i>So, whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. <b title='used to say hello or goodbye, esp in the morning or afternoon'>Good day</b>! (Monica and Phoebe <b title='re- - again'>reenter</b> the apartment and Monica closes the door on a <b title='very shocked or upset'>stunned</b> Mrs. Green.) I can't feel my legs!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You were <b title='extremely good'>fantastic</b>! I'm so proud of you!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah? I'm proud of me too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You should be!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title="You will get what you want">You got it</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs. Green.) Mrs. Green! Ok I'm really sorry! I'm apologizing for the- (She <b title='trip - hit your foot on sth and fall down ↗stumble, twist, sprain'>trips</b> and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Ok, I <b title='bite_bit_bitten'>bit</b> my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
<s>Ross and Rachel's, Ross is helping Rachel study for when the baby comes.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(closing a book) Ok! I'm ready.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You sure?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer's voice) Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozle! (Reading from a notecard.) How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, put your elbow in it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='not hungry'>Full</b>, dry, on its back, and no loose <b title='sheets, blankets, etc'>covers</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's correct! There's a hopping bonus here, but I don't suggest you take it. Ok, ooh, ooh, here, this is an audio question, what'd you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is <b title='choke - make sb unable to breathe properly'>choking</b> a cat.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, <b title='help a baby to pass gas loudly from its stomach out through its mouth ↗belch'>burp</b> it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wangle card?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>A card! A card! I pick a card!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozle! You're gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him <b title='with the mouth wide open, esp showing surprise or shock'>agape</b>.) I've <b title='lose sight of - forget/stop considering'>lost sight of</b> why we're doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.) (Still in announcer voice) Please don't walk away! I've gone too far!<br>

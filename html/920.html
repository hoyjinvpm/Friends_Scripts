<i>Phoebe</i>What is it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a <b title='feeling angry, jealous, and upset'>bitter</b> woman's journey through life".<br>

<i>Ross</i>Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around <b title='an area of land that contains the main buildings of a university or college ↗faculty, premises'>campus</b>.<br>

<i>Charlie</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And you called him Alby?! (laughs) I mean that's, that's like... calling <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Wiki</a>]'>Albert Einstein</b>... er... Alby...<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Yeah, well, he is a, <b title='extremely clever'>brilliant</b> man.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of <b title='...to estimate the age of organic materials, such as wood and leather... [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating">Wiki</a>]'>radiocarbon dating</b> <b title='if sth increases or decreases by a factor of ten, it increases or decreases by ten times'>by a factor of 10</b>!<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of <b title='problems'>issues</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗intrigue'>very interested</b>) Oh! like what? (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to <b title="try to find out details about sb else's private life in an impolite way ↗gossip">pry</b>... it's just that this must be what <b title='↗ordinary, mundane, mortal'>regular</b> people experience when they watch "<b title='a weekday television entertainment news program [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Hollywood">Wiki</a>]'>Access Hollywood</b>".<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Ok, you want the <b title="information about sb's private life or activities which could give people a bad opinion of them if it became known ↗scandal">dirt</b>? Alby was seriously <b title='≠confident'>insecure</b>. I mean, he was really <b title='intimidate - frighten, threaten, intimate'>intimidated</b> by the guy I dated before him.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>A guy who won two.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(a little suprised) Two? What...? Don't tell me you-you dated Benjamin Hobart.<br>
<i>Charlie</i>Yeah... for three years.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>(smiling and thinks for a moment) No. But-oh there was my first boyfriend Billy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?<br>
<i>Charlie</i>No, but he <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> just win <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellows_Program">Wiki</a>]'>the McArthur genius grant</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, Ross!<br>
<i>Rache</i>How is it <b title='go - happen'>going</b> with Charlie?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗ironic'>sarcastically</b>) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm gonna <b title="blow sb's brains out - kill sb with a shot to the head">blow my... eh. average-sized brains out</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, What's the matter?<br>
<i>Ross</i>She only dates <b title='↗gene, genie, genius'>geniuses</b> and-and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the Chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/MammothVsMastodon.jpg/220px-MammothVsMastodon.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth">Wiki</a>]'>woolly mammoth</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I always loved that.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they <b title="be out of sb's league - too good/difficult/expensive etc for sb">are so out of my league</b>! Oh, my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Worse?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh much, much worse. I did my <b title='imitation'>impression</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers">Wiki</a>]'>Joan Rivers</b> as one of the earliest <b title='amphibian - animals such as frogs that can live both on land and in water'>amphibians</b>... (<b title='↗motion, signal'>gestures</b> with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's <b title='↗elephant, walrus, boar (male wild pig)'>tusks</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? (turns around to look at Rachel)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on! I think that's funny! (Ross leaves)
<s>Chandler in the theater.</s>
<i>Bitter lady</i>Well, <b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> you are all thinking that "Now would be a really great time for an <b title='a short period of time between the parts of a play, concert etc =interval'>intermission</b>", huh?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To himself) oh yes, God yes!<br>
<i>Bitter lady</i>(now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! <b title='because'>'Cause</b> in life there are no intermissions, people. Now, Chapter 7, Divorce is a <b title='↗shit, fuck, crap'>4 letter word</b>. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
<s>The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, cice to meet you.<br>
<i>Dirk</i>Hey! So what show are you on?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'm no an actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.<br>
(Dirk is confused)<br>
<i>Joey</i>A science.<br>
<i>Dirk</i>Oh! Hey, well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won a Nobel prize.<br>
(Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, well, no, but I mean, she-she only goes out with really, really smart guys.<br>
<i>Dirk</i>Hey, I got a 690 on my <b title='standardized test for most college admissions in the United States [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">Wiki</a>] Ross got 1250, but he claimed he got 1450'>SATs</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I<b title='would'>'d</b> <b title='have sth as the main item of news'>lead with</b> that.<br>
(Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's it, just sign right on the <b title='↗lingerie, panties, knickers, tights, pantyhose'>bra</b> (the actor does so).<br>
<i>Joey</i>Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Don't worry Joe, I-I won't come next year!<br>
(Joey, <b title='calmly accept a situation that is bad, but cannot be changed ↗frustrated'>resigned</b>, walks to Rachel's table)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Rachel) What you got there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, just some boys gave me their phone numbers.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, let me, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little <b title='slut - a woman who has sex with a lot of different people'>slutty</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(drunken voice) I think I am.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(browsing the tissues) Let me see if I <b title='think that sb/sth is good, right, or suitable'>approve</b> any of these clowns. This guy wears a <b title='a small blanket'>rug</b> (<b title='discard - throw away'>discards</b> one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a <b title='an extreme religious group that is not part of an established religion'>cult</b>, ok, and it costs you $5,000 to get to level three and I don't feel any different.<br>
(Rachel is puzzled)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) <b title='to not accept'>Pass</b>, pass, oh pass, pass...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, nothing <b title='important'>major</b>, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, you're so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who? (looks around)<br>
(Joey <b title='↗signal, gesture'>motions</b> for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, because we live together, it's a joke!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(they high-five) Oh, Very funny... Really.<br>
(Joey leaves. Rachel <b title='gulp - swallow large quantities of food or drink quickly ↗sip, swig, gobble, slug, drain, down'>gulps</b> down what's left of her drink and <b title='grimace - twist your face in an ugly way because you are annoyed, disgusted, or in pain'>grimaces</b>.)<br>
(Chandler walks in)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, my God, honey, I'm so so so so so so sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You really liked it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16, "fat, single and ready to <b title='get to know people, hook up etc'>mingle</b>", I was <b title='feeling happier and more hopeful'>uplifted</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation">Menstruation</a>]'>period</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did somebody sign your bra?<br>
<i>Monica</i>So I got it when I was 13.
<s>At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey Ross! So, listen, about you and-and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's actually a million dollar prize.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='be nice, cool'>Go</b> Charlie! But my <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b> is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, <b title='spend time in conditions that are much worse than you are used to'>slum it</b> with some <b title='a regular person with no outstandingly good qualities, and no very bad characteristics either.'>average Joe</b> <b title='Doctor of Philosophy [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhD">Wiki</a>] ↗MD (Doctor of Medicine)'>PhD</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, maybe. And I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I-I could still win a Nobel prize. Although, the last two papers I-I've written were widely <b title="to discredit sb/sth means to cause them to lose people's respect or trust.">discredited</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...<br>
<i>Ross</i>And sexy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to express approval'>Good for you</b>! Hey, and I thought your paper on <b title='a theory in evolutionary biology [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium">Wiki</a>] ↗punctuate (interrupt), punctuation'>punctuated equilibrium</b> in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian_era">Wiki</a>]'>Devonian era</b> was <b title='first-rate, excellent'>top-notch</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Stop <b title='go through - examine/search'>going through</b> my <b title='things'>stuff</b>! (Walks away)<br>
(Rachel approaches Monica)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(to Monica) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I just wanted to let you know, I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, you can't! Friends <b title='hook up - have a sexual relationship with sb ↗fool around, mess around'>hooking up</b> is a bad idea.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Please, what about you and Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's different! I was drunk and stupid!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well hello! (Points to herself)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I could, I could, but I don't want to! I wanna kiss Joey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(pause) I'm gonna do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And I can't stop you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, can I at least have the phone numbers!<br>
(Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?<br>
(Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm smarter than him!
<s>The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you're so wonderful.<br>
<i>Bitter woman</i>Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Can't believe you guys <b title='buy - believe sth that someone tells you'>bought</b> that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).<br>

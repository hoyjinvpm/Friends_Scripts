<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey is balancing a mini <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey">Wiki</a>]'>hockey</b> stick on his hand as Chandler enters from his room carrying a bunch of bills.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(watches Joey for a moment) Ok! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he's scratching his back with it.) Listen, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be moving out so you, are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right! And when is that due?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>First of the month.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's every month?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, just the months you actually want to live here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ahh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looking at it) Oh my God!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's our phone number. <b title="used for getting sb's attention ">Now</b> look, I know I <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='spring sth on sb - tell sb sth that they do not expect'>sprung this whole me moving out on you things</b>, so why don't I just- I just cover you for a while?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no! <b title='used to say "no" in a forceful way ↗not really, nah, nope'>No way</b>! Joey Tribbiani does not take <b title='money or gifts given to help people who are poor, sick etc'>charity</b>... <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's not charity, Joe...<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know! Forget it! Ok? I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take care of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok uh, here's the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>This is how much we pay for electric?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, yeah.<br>
(Joey runs over and shuts off the lights.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about trying to give Joey some money.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, how much do you think he needs?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I <b title='think'>figure</b> $1,500 would <b title='if a sum of money covers the cost of sth, it is enough to pay for it'>cover</b> him for a few months, you know? But I have to <b title='deceive'>trick</b> him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and <b title='perform'>put on</b> little <b title='skit - a short amusing play'>skits</b>. Just whatever you want.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well that would help the pride thing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering from her room) Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey! Wow! You look great! Do you <b title='want to'>wanna</b> move in with me tomorrow?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(thinks) Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that, Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And also, my birthday.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's not your birthday.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What a <b title='not kind'>mean</b> thing to say! I would never tell you it was not your birthday!<br>
(Joey and Ross enter.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! So, you guys have anything planned for the <b title='important'>big</b> last night?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, instead of just <b title='hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hanging out</b>, we figure we do nothing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa, <b title='a professional basketball team [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks">Wiki</a>]'>Knicks</b> season <b title='the first of a series of games in a sports competition'>opener</b> tonight. I, thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a <b title='paleontology - the study of fossils'>paleontologist</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering...<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well and clearly not a minute sooner.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, you are packed <b title='used for emphasis ↗intensive, intensifier'>though</b> right, please tell me that you're packed.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Of course I packed! Monica, relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion on what I should wear tonight.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this.<br>
[Cut to Rachel's bedroom, Phoebe and she are entering. And it's obvious that she's not packed.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, yeah, I know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Rachel, I need to borrow- You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Surprise!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, don't get mad <b title='because'>'cause</b> look- this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am <b title='bad ↗suck'>lousy</b> at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, <b title='exclamation when sth is finished'>tada</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(grabs a bag of those <b title='Foam peanuts, also known as packing peanuts or packing noodles, are a common loose-fill packaging and cushioning material used to prevent damage to fragile objects during shipping. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrofoam_peanut">Wiki</a>]'>Styrofoam peanuts</b>) I'll be <b title='sb who organizes the way people work together in a particular activity ↗supervisor, liaison'>coordinator</b>! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Ok, look, everybody has to help! Ok? Phoebe, you can help, can't you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I have plans.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Your plans were with us.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's right.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to <b title='help'>help out</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! (To Rachel) My God, thank you!!<br>
[Cut to living room, Phoebe enters and closes Rachel's door behind her.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves! (The guys <b title='move quickly in a hurried awkward way'>scramble</b> for the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering and interrupting the guy's escape attempt) Ok! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I thought you said you were gonna do nothing.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, but for the last time.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok fine, now, Ross...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, but-but I can't do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Don't you have Ben?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because, because I have Ben.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's at a dinner party.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is he really coming? Because I can see into your apartment!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Of course he is! Eh, what, you think <b title='I would'>I'd</b> just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel's room.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to the guys) I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go make a fake Ben.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey is entering carrying two pizzas.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Here it is! Our last pizzas together as <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate, roomie'>roommates</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I wish I'd know you were gonna do that, I ordered <b title='Chinese food'>Chinese</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Oh that's ok. Hey, actually, in a way it's kinda nice. You know, our last dinner together, me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!<br>
(Chandler stares at him, <b title='so shocked that you cannot speak ↗dumbstruck, stunned, astounded, astonished'>dumbfounded</b>, then finally agrees.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used for suggesting sth'>Say</b>, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. <b title='used for making a suggestion'>What do you say</b> we play a little uh, <b title='table football'>foosball</b> for money?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury <b title='plague - cause pain, suffering, or trouble to sb'>plagued</b> '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes it would. What do you say to $50?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I say to it: "$50, you are more than I have."<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If you know that you are gonna win though, what difference does it make?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, you're <b title="performing">on</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, <b title='according to the way a situation appears, although you cannot be sure ↗clearly, decidedly, evidently, obviously'>apparently</b>.<br>
(They start playing.)
<s>Rachel's bedroom, she's in her closet bringing down her pair of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollerblade">Wiki</a>] ↗inline skates'>rollerblades</b> from a top shelf.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohhh, look, it's the rollerblades.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(starting to cry) Oh God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You remember when we got these?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh I guess you weren't there. (They <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... (She starts laughing <b title='↗frantically, frantic'>hysterically</b>.) You don't remember?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm gonna miss you so much.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. You know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think about some other things you're not gonna miss.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't think there's anything.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on, there's <b title='got to'>gotta</b> be something.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, she's perfect.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh. (pauses) I have one.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good! Great! <b title='↗your turn'>You can go first</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact, that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica <b title='lag - move or develop more slowly than others'>lags</b> behind the laugh a little bit.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good, that's a good one. Ok, Monica, anything? You know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, good. <b title='used when you think you have proved to sb that what you are telling them is right / you did it right'>There you go</b>. Doesn't anyone feel better?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You get your messages!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, well I don't think it really <b title='count - be considered/included'>counts</b> if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Great! It worked! No one's sad.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, they are just finishing up another game of foosball.</s>
<i>Joey</i>(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the <b title='↗refrigerator, freezer'>fridge</b> and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500, that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there's nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the <b title='sparse - not dense, thick or crowded; thinly scattered'>sparseness</b> of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, give me a chance to win my money back. Ok? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You serious?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yes!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, get ready to owe me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>. Ready?<br>
[In slow motion, as some <b title='haunt - (of a ghost) to appear in a place repeatedly'>haunty</b> <b title='relating to a demon'>demonic</b> music plays in the background, Joey throws the ball in, Chandler quits playing and <b title='go for - try to get'>goes for</b> his Chinese food. Joey <b title='smack - hit sth hard ↗spank, slap'>smacks</b> the ball really hard, shooting it down the table. Chandler slowly takes a bite, the ball bounces off of the wall, <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> back up the table, and scores the goal for Chandler.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! No! No! No- (Joey looks at him) - one can beat me.<br>
(In <b title='an annoyed or impatient feeling that you get when you are prevented from doing what you want ↗desperate'>frustration</b>, Joey kicks the table, breaking it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Monica answers it as Rachel and Phoebe move a box into the living room.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh, your brother. <b title='an exclamation of happiness ↗yay'>Score</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(on phone) <b title="'Hello'; 'Is there anything wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, <b title='give him the phone'>put him on</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking <b title='at the present time ↗just now, by now, right away'>right now</b>. Uh He's smiling <b title='but'>though</b>! Ok, talk to you later. (hangs up the phone and sits down to turn on the game. He looks over at his fake son.) You know, Daddy was gonna be a basketball player.

<s>Rachel's bedroom, Rachel is entering carrying two glasses of wine. She gives one to Phoebe, keeps one, and completely ignores Monica.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the rollerblades? Oh.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"<br>
<i>Monica</i>"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. <b title='at any time'>Ever</b>!"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! I call her!<br>
<i>Monica</i>"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just <b title='step awkwardly ↗fumble, stagger'>stumble</b> across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b> and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You guys, come on, this is the last night!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you're right-you're right, (to Monica) and so, for the last time I would like to ask you: <b title='imitation of the sound of sb crying or sobbing'>Boo hoo</b>! Get out of my room!<br>
(Monica picks up one of those boxes of hair curling things, dumps it in a box, and storms out.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna <b title='be able to go to sth that has been arranged '>make</b> those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey is examining the broken foosball table as Chandler enters from his room.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Still broken?<br>
<i>Joey</i>This <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b> <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>! Your last night here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you know, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little <b title='also known as twenty-one [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">Wiki</a>]'>Blackjack</b>? (Holds up a deck of cards.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nah, not my game.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, uh, how about, how about - you know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, what's it called?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='spot - notice'>Spots</b> a cup) Cups.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know how to play Cups.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll teach you. Come on, come on, it's really easy, really, really fun.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, <b title='here you are'>here you go</b>. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?<br>
<i>Joey</i>A two and a five.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah! Ok, let's play again. Ready? (He deals out two cards each again.) What you got?<br>
<i>Joey</i>A four and a nine.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're kidding right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. Why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well that's a full cup! (Pays him again.)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used when sth is impressive or surprising'>Damn</b>! I am good at Cups!
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Monica is <b title='whine - complain in a sad, annoying voice =moan ↗groan'>whining</b> to Phoebe about Rachel.</s>
<i>Monica</i>I'm not talking to her!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Maybe you're right- She made fun of my phone pen!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know, I took it hard too. She's in there right now, crying. I can hear her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(goes up to the door to listen) She's not crying.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She's <b title='if you hold in an emotion or feeling, you do not allow yourself to express it'>holding it in</b>. She's so brave. Go.<br>
(Monica goes into Rachel's room.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Listen, Rachel, I feel really bad about what happened- What are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm unpacking!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, <b title='not forming a straight line'>crookedly</b>.) Is that picture straight?<br>
<i>Monica</i>It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey, you know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why do I have to leave?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because it's my apartment!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well it's mine too! What else you got?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>How about, you're moving! (Grabs <b title='a (large) number of'>a bunch of</b> clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same <b title='things'>stuff</b> over and over again as Rachel <b title='chant - repeat a word or phrase again and again ↗chorus'>chants</b> "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok Monica! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, how are you guys doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Great! Monica's moving!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) I am not!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh really?! Then <b title='why'>how come</b> all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Ok, you guys... STOP! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No Phoebe I am mad!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, deep-deep-deep down!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I'm just mad!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
<s>Chandler and Joey's, they're still playing Cups.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>You win.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, what did you have?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well it doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Ok, now how much you've won <b title='until now'>so far</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not 700 exactly?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Double it! (He does.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, I didn't <b title='↗invent'>make up</b> the rules. Ok, so now after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Oh no no, don't get too excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get- <b title='impossible ↗incredible, unbelievable'>No way</b>! (He takes the top card, which is the two of <b title='↗diamonds, spades, hearts'>clubs</b>. Of course, any card would've won. Chandler pays him.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Monica carries a box out of Rachel's room.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Huh. So funny, 'cause I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore.<br>
<i>Monica and Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're just so <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> to each other! And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Phoebe that's fine, because I'm not moving.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! You know I-I know I said some really bad stuff about her, but you know Rachel <b title='do - used for emphasis'>does</b> have some good qualities that-that make her a good roommate.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh really? Like what Monica?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, good start Mon.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She lets you borrow them.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah and you stretch them out with your big old <b title='a performer in a circus who wears funny clothes and bright make-up'>clown</b> feet.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you wanna live outside?! Because that's getting cold! (To Phoebe) She gets <b title='lots of'>tons of</b> catalogs, and umm, she'll fold on the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What else?<br>
<i>Monica</i>When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.<br>
<i>Monica</i>When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know what, I don't want you to be cold.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And, when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! (They both <b title='break down - be unable to stop yourself crying, esp in public ↗collapse'>break down</b> in tears.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, it's gonna be fine.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok Rachel, now I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh that's right. You're still <b title='determined about'>set on</b> that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Kinda. What? (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!<br>
[Cut to Ross's apartment, he's watching TV and eating some popcorn as the phone rings.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how's the packing <b title='go - happen'>going</b>? (Listens) Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right- Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head <b title='out of'>outta</b> your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, (Ohh, that's the last time I'm ever gonna type that line. It's just so sad.) Joey is entering, angrily.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little <b title='rest'>break</b>, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wh- How did you lose at Cups?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sitting Down Bonus! <b title='↗in the meantime'>Meanwhile</b>, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothing!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh man!<br>
<i>Joey</i>And he never played <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b> either! You know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, let's just play one more hand! Just one more hand!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, no more! I cannot lose another <b title='10 cents ↗nickel, quarter'>dime</b>! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a- I wanna give you something ok? And let me give it too you now before I <b title='leave a possession with a pawnbroker, for which they give money but which they can also sell if the money is not paid back within a particular time'>pawn</b> it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kind of, you know, like a thank you for being such a great roommate.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can't take the big white dog! You love it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's him, not it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> I bought it from you, you know? And then your-your nice <b title='an action that you take which expresses your feelings or intentions'>gesture</b> would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>When did I try to give you money?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Points to the couch) Before, over there, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you <b title='stopped talking about'>dropped</b> it. Ok? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we <b title='gamble - bet money'>gambled</b>, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now <b title='very unexpected ↗out of nowhere'>out of the blue</b>, you start with the charity thing again!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm just trying to help you out! Ok? I wanna make sure that you're ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I will be ok! Look, Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Ok? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss... is you. And now the dog.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, (And that's the last time for that line, no more Chandler and Joey's or Monica and Rachel's, ever!) Joey and Ross are carrying the last table of Rachel's. Rachel follows slowly, but is stopped by Monica.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Hey. Call me when you get there. Ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm really gonna miss you.<br>
(They hug.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title="↗my pleasure, you're welcome, not at all, no problem, sure">Yeah</b>.<br>
(Silence <b title='ensue - happen after sth else'>ensues</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye house!<br>
(They break the <b title='hug'>embrace</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye <b title='used for talking to a close friend or sb you love'>babe</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bye.<br>
(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel's old and now empty room.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She really left.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. (He kisses her.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No problem, roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)<br>
(And with that, an era ends as Chandler moves in with Monica as Rachel moves in with Phoebe. It's a sad and happy time for Friends.)
<s>Ross's apartment, Chandler is trying to get Joey's money back from Ross.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And now you want that money back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Exactly.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler, what kind of an <b title='↗retarded, imbecile, moron'>idiot</b> do you <b title='if you take sb/sth for sth, you think that they are that thing'>take me for</b>? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's not a real game! I made it up!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it <b title='honestly and without cheating'>fair and square</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>At a fake game!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok! Now I assume the Saucer card <b title='come up - appear'>came up</b> when you played last.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)<br><br>

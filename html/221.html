It's just, I have like no family left, you know. I mean, except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says.

<i>Monica</i>Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well uh, I had breakfast here so <b title='according to a strict way of understanding the meaning of a rule or set of facts'>technically</b> I saved $3.50.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How did you make $17?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, my <b title='visually/physically/mentally etc challenged - unable to do particular things without difficulty because of being disabled in some way'>financially challenged</b> friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>What happened to uh, MEG?<br>
<i>Monica</i>MEG was good for me but I <b title='dump - get rid of'>dumped</b> her. You know, my <b title='a short sentence or phrase that expresses a belief or purpose ↗fable, proverb'>motto</b> is get out before they go down.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(enters) Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey Pheebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice <b title='Upstate New York is an area of New York north of the New York City metropolitan area'>Upstate</b>.

<i>Joey</i>Good.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, thank God.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.<br>
{Once in a Blue Moon ... is a common way of saying not very often, but what exactly is a Blue Moon?<br>
According to the popular definition, it is the second Full Moon to occur in a single calendar month.<br>
The average interval between Full Moons is about 29.5 days, whilst the length of an average month is roughly 30.5 days. This makes it very unlikely that any given month will contain two Full Moons, though it does sometimes happen.<br>
On average, there will be 41 months that have two Full Moons in every century, so you could say that once in a Blue Moon actually means once every two-and-a-half years.}<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. (goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica)<br>
<i>Monica</i>DON'T...be too long with the phone.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, she'll be a much better friend once the market closes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(dials the phone) It's a woman.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so talk to her.<br>

<i>Frank</i>Hey lady. Hey <b title='used to tell someone to stop, so that you can talk to them or go with them ↗hang up, warm up, cool down'>wait up</b>. How do you know my dad?<br>

<i>Frank</i><b title='good/cool/awesome/intense'>Heavy</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?<br>
<i>Frank</i>No, but he didn't really talk about anything.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Except <b title='stilt - one of two poles which you can stand on and walk high above the ground [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilts">Wiki</a>] <img src="600px-Echasseurs-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Echasseurs.jpg/600px-Echasseurs.jpg"> ↗stealth'>stilts</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Stilts?<br>
<i>Frank</i>Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's <b title='handbag'>purse</b>, and uh, <b title='suddenly'>all of a sudden</b> I look over and there's my dad's head <b title='bob - move quickly in a particular direction'>bobbing</b> past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know what to do with that.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Me neither. So you're like my <b title='↗little sister'>big sister</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Well this is huge, you can buy me a beer.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah I know, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'<br>
<i>Frank</i>I gotta friend named Mark.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That'll work too.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Cool, alright. So, maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or something, you know.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, that'd be ok.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Alright.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I'm in the <b title='the phone book'>book</b>.<br>
<i>Frank</i>Ok, yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alright. So um, stilts huh?<br>
<i>Frank</i>Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the <b title='an open pipe fixed to the edge of a roof to collect and carry away rain water [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gutter">Wiki</a>] <img src="170px-Weeds_in_Gutter-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/Weeds_in_Gutter.jpg/170px-Weeds_in_Gutter.jpg">'>rain gutter</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Well we did it, we're here. We are <b title='hold/stand your ground - stay where you are when sb threatens you, in order to show them that you are not afraid'>standing our ground</b>. How long does a cup of coffee take?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Would you come on! Come on! (waitress brings their coffee) Thank you.<br>
(They rush to put the cream and sugar in their cups and <b title='swallow large quantities of food or drink quickly ↗sip, swig, down, gobble'>gulp</b> down a few drinks)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ah, <b title='"There we go" is essentially the same as "There you go." The difference is that you are including yourself in the sentence out of politeness or because you are part of the action. Example: You are teaching your partner the tango. "There we go. Now we&#039;re dancing."

<i>Chandler</i>Alright, let's do this.<br>
<i>Little Bully</i>Alright.<br>
(They all put up their fists and prepare to fight)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What'd you mean?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.<br>
<i>Big Bully</i>No, you can't use your watch.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. (reaches in his pocket)<br>
<i>Big Bully</i>Or your keys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Little Bully</i>Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. (They all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box) Alright, come on man, let's do this.<br>
(They all jump in the street and prepare to fight)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Before I forget, are we hitting faces?<br>
<i>Big Bully</i>Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.<br>
<i>Little Bully</i>Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.<br>

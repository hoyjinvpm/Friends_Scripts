<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are sitting around the table.</s>
<i>Monica</i>So thanks for <b title='come by - visit ↗stop by'>coming by</b> guys we just wanted to <b title="bounce off - try out an idea on sb / get sb's opinion of an idea">bounce a few ideas off</b> you about the wedding ceremony.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(starting to cry) Ohh...<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's the matter? You ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, it's just you know...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) Monica said wedding.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something at the ceremony.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! I would love to read a poem.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do you think you could <b title='complete'>get through</b> a poem?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(crying) It'll be a short one.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, so Ross will be doing the reading.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Too?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you mind telling us what it is?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Sorry, I'm <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> keeping this one <b title='secretly'>on the q.t.</b><br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves <b title='wink - close one eye and open it again quickly'>winking</b>. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering, excited) Hey!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...<br>
<i>Monica</i>What is DOOL?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not <b title='going to'>gonna</b> believe it! My character is coming out of his <b title='a deep unconscious state, usu lasting a long time and caused by serious illness or injury ↗pass out'>coma</b>!<br>
<i>All</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's great!<br>
<i>Joey</i>And-and-and not only that, I'm getting a new brain!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being <b title="transplant - take an organ, skin etc from one person, animal, part of the body etc and put it into or onto another ↗donation">transplanted</b> into my body.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? A brain transplant?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(seriously) Yes, it's a highly <b title='causing a lot of angry public discussion and disagreement'>controversial</b> procedure. So-<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's ridiculous!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Monica and Rachel) It's winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, <b title='in a way that shows you know or understand sth'>knowingly</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who are they killing off?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh <b title='↗Marilyn Monroe'>Cecilia Monroe</b>, she plays Jessica Lockhart.<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>Noo!<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's my favorite character on DOOL.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nice.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a <b title='a drink'>beverage</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And the way she <b title='↗smack, slam, spank'>slaps</b> <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wouldn't you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Don't do it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Cecilia Monroe, <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>, what a great actress.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, <b title='used to say that you already know how bad sth is, esp because you have experienced it yourself'>tell me about it</b>. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to <b title='do a job that she used to do, and do it as well as she did ↗take over, surrogate'>fill her shoes</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah-yeah, <b title='help out - help'>help me out</b> here, when you, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to <b title='understand'>get</b>? I thought you were a scientist!
<s>Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch in Central <b title='percolate - make coffee using a machine in which hot water passes through crushed coffee beans into a container below'>Perk</b>.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or <b title='↗straight, lesbian, homosexual, heterosexual, come out (of the closet)'>gay</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah? Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Mainly because he's kissing that other guy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no not that guy there. That guy, <b title='exactly'>right</b> there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh. Oh yeah, he's too <b title='very pretty or attractive'>cute</b> to be straight.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh <b title="an offensive word for a woman's breasts ↗rack, boob">knockers</b> will help us <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth or solve a problem'>figure it out</b>. (She walks <b title='past'>by</b> and he <b title='looks at her'>checks her out</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, straight, and not <b title='delicate and complicated in an attractive way ↗sophisticated'>subtle</b>. (The man gets up and leaves.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, he left his cell phone.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in <b title='a place where things that are lost are kept until sb comes to claim them'>lost and found</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh. <b title='used to make a suggestion ↗what do you say'>What if</b>, um, if he calls his own cell phone to-to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a <b title="a traditional children's story in which magic things happen">fairy tale</b> for the digital age.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah... That does sound great. I'm gonna get the phone. (They both get up.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? Wait! Why... why do you get the story?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. I haven't been out on a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> in so long.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... (quietly) having sex.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Ok, see? I get the phone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title="used to say 'no' in a forceful way ↗not really">No way</b>! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! (<b title='break up - be really troubled with sth, to the point of crying ↗on the verge of tears'>Breaking up</b>) And until now, I didn't think I would love again.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to say sb has not been successful in doing sth, es in persuading you or tricking you'>Nice try</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know.<br>
(They <b title='move gradually with several small movements'>edge</b> closer to the phone on the table.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well umm, maybe we could uhh... (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!<br>
(She holds the phone out and starts <b title='taunt - try to make sb angry or upset by saying unkind things to them ↗tease, mock'>taunting</b> Phoebe. Phoebe calmingly knocks the phone out of Rachel's hand and catches it.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ah-ha! Too <b title='very confident in an annoying way ↗snobbish, strut, arrogant, patronize, condescend, despise'>cocky</b>!
<s>Silvercup Studios, Joey is watching Jessica Lockhart perform a scene.</s>
<i>Dina</i>I'm going to keep <b title='date - have a romantic relationship with sb'>dating</b> him mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!<br>
<i>Jessica Lockhart</i>Oh yes there is!<br>
<i>Dina</i>What're you going to do? Kill him? Like you <b title='do - kill/murder'>did</b> Charles?!<br>
<i>Jessica Lockhart</i>(<b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>) That was an accident! And so were you.<br>
<i>Dina</i>Well, at least I'm not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)<br>
<i>Jessica Lockhart</i>(crying) Oh, my baby! (<b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>Hugs</b> Dina, but moves Dina's head to her other shoulder so that she's the only one in the picture.)<br>
<i>The Director</i>Cut!<br>
(Joey walks up to Cecilia Monroe who plays Jessica.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Oh, just years of experience.<br>
<i>Dina</i>(crying) Can I get some ice here?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>You're not the fan who's dying are you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but that's not supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Oh that was a real person?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any <b title='tip - advice'>tips</b> you can give me...<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>I-I-I'm leaving the show?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(quickly) I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Who told you that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh uh, one of the writers.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Which one? Was it <b title='with little or no hair on your head'>bald</b> or was it tall?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Umm...<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>you know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>And if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip! (She throws her drink in his face.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ms. Monroe... (She slaps him) Oh <b title='used when sb does sth annoying that they often do'>there you go</b>. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the <b title='violence or extreme force ↗velocity'>ferocity</b> of the slap they just received.)
<s>Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still arguing over the phone.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>No, Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Ok look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his <b title='a feature on a telephone that enables you to ring a number by pressing only one button'>speed dial</b>, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> from that we can <b title='know'>tell</b> who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, we can decide by whoever's name is closer to the word phone.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't think so.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(handing Rachel the phone) Fine, all right, but <b title='used to say you are sure about sth'>I bet</b> you'd be <b title="sing a different tone - be forced to change one's ways, attitude, behavior, etc">singing another tune</b> if we were fighting over a <b title='a machine part consisting of a wheel or bar with teeth on it, which allows movement in only one direction [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet">Wiki</a>] <img src="100px-Ratchet_example-1.gif" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Ratchet_example.gif/100px-Ratchet_example.gif"> <img src="150px-Click-torque-wrench-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Click-torque-wrench.jpg/150px-Click-torque-wrench.jpg"> <img src="120px-Purim_gragger-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Purim_gragger.jpg/120px-Purim_gragger.jpg">'>ratchet</b>.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, I lost my mom to <b title='the act of killing yourself ↗homicide, pesticide, herbicide'>suicide</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Blueberry_Macro_2.JPG/220px-Blueberry_Macro_2.JPG"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry">Wiki</a>]'>blueberry</b> <b title='The term muffin typically refers to an individual sized quick bread product which can be sweet or savory.

<i>Phoebe</i>Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well, now, see this isn't telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe, Carlos, Yoga, Ben.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wait, <b title='a Hindu philosophy that teaches you how to control your body and mind in the belief that you can become united with the spirit of the universe in this way'>yoga</b>! I do Yoga! That's one for me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. Oh, so close. Only it said <b title='a slightly sour, thick liquid made from milk'>yogurt</b>. Ooh! Peter Luger! That's a <b title='a restaurant that specializes in serving steak ↗coffee/soft house'>steak house</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>So you don't know that's Barneys the store! That can be you know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barneys the store on their speed dial?<br>

What is important is: while we appreciate the <b title='sth that you do to communicate your intentions towards sb, esp good intentions'>gesture</b>, we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because we <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> them.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on that's not fair! You haven't even heard me play!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We have heard you play.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, you've heard my practice. Ok? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be <b title='to a small degree'>a wee bit</b> <b title='of'>o'</b> celebration.
<s>Silvercup Studios, Joey is getting <b title='pointer - advice ↗tip'>pointers</b> on how to play Jessica Lockhart.</s>
<i>Cecilia</i>So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room <b title='for example'>for instance</b>, she owns everything and every person in that room. (Joey is nodding.) You try.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok! (He <b title='scurry - move fast with small quick steps'>scurries</b> out the <b title='the set for a play, film, or television show is the furniture and scenery that is on the stage when the play is being performed or in the studio where filming takes place.'>set</b> door and re-enters, extremely impressed) All right!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Ok. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it! (Joey gets a <b title='treating people as if they are not as good or as important as you ↗snobbish'>snooty</b> look on his face.) All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I-I don't know what I'm gonna do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh then-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. you know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to <b title='shake up - make changes'>shake things up</b>, play different characters. You're so <b title='↗gifted'>talented</b>.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>I am. I am, but I don't know you know? An actor of a certain age, it's not that easy.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at <b title='born 16 October 1925 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Lansbury">Wiki</a>]'>Angela Lansb</b>-<b title='born Angelina Jolie Voight; June 4, 1975 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie">Wiki</a>]'>Angelina Jolie</b>!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but you know I just got so <b title='comfortable ↗snuggle, nestle'>comfy</b> here! And... Ohh, I <b title='turn down - refuse to accept an offer or request'>turned down</b> some amazing work!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Like-like what?<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the <b title='the general situation'>landscape</b> of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9xico">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-MEX_orthographic.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/MEX_orthographic.svg/220px-MEX_orthographic.svg.png">'>Mexican</b> cinema would be very different today!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(impressed) Wow!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>But... Well now, now's a different time for me. (Starts to cry.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, ok? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "<b title='used as an exclamation'>Boy</b>, she-she is a great actress!" (She's not <b title='buy - believe'>buying</b> it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is <b title='sexy'>hot</b>!"<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>(<b title='very interested'>intrigued</b>) You think I'm hot?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You own the room. (She smiles and stares <b title='in a way that shows you want sth very much ↗eager, keen'>longingly</b> into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh...<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face. (She does so.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that <b title='because'>'cause</b> she's so passionate?<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her hands off his face.) You <b title='want to'>wanna</b> try it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Ok. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>That was good, that was really good. But I-I think that maybe your hands're just a little off, they should be maybe like <b title='exactly'>right</b> like... (She grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)
<s>Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are waiting for the cute guy to <b title='arrive at the place where sb is waiting for you'>show up</b> for his cell phone. Rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and moving into it. Phoebe tries to steal some.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Hey!<br>
(There is a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>(<b title='happening or being done at exactly the same time'>simultaneously</b>) Who is it?<br>
<i>Guy</i>Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to <b title='get'>pick up</b> the phone.<br>
(Rachel excitedly jumps up and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> for the door.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Whoa! Why do you <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> answer the door?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well why shouldn't I?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>'Cause it's my apartment!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.<br>
(Phoebe opens the door and Tom, an older gentleman with white hair, enters.)<br>
<i>Tom</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) You're not the man who left the cell phone.<br>
<i>Tom</i>No, that's my assistant.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)<br>
<i>Tom</i>Umm, no.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Could you-could you umm, give us one second?<br>
<i>Tom</i>Sure!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> back sir.<br>
<i>Tom</i>Sure.<br>
(They walk into the living room.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wh-what do we do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't know!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Can you believe this? (Rachel <b title='exhale - breathe air etc out through your mouth or nose ≠inhale ↗gasp'>exhales</b> in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm, <b title='Gods'>they</b> just don't make <b title='them (hot guys)'>'em</b> like that anymore you know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, <b title='hot guys get older'>you just have to wait</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really <b title='feel that you ought to do sth for sb or give them sth, esp because they have done sth for you'>owe</b> you one.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me, you owe me <b title='adverb in an impressive way'>big</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! You're such a great friend!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh...<br>
<i>Tom</i>So, which one of you lovely ladies am I gonna take to dinner huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh that'd be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.<br>
<i>Tom</i>Ok. Ok. (Exits and Phoebe <b title='looks at him'>checks him out</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(whispering) Nice!
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Cecilia is entering the living room from Joey's room followed by Joey.</s>
<i>Cecilia</i>Well, you certainly own that room.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Actually I rent the whole place and, <b title='get - understand. She meant he is great in bed.'>I just got what you meant</b>. Thank you.<br>
(She laughs as Rachel enters.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
(Rachel <b title='↗deadpan, dumbfounded, dumbstruck'>stops dead in her tracks</b> when she sees whom Joey is with.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! Oh my God! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Well, it's nice to know that you...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(screaming) MONICA! MONICA! (Runs to Monica's.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That uh, that is my <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b> Rachel.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Oh that explains all the women's underwear.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(shrugs) Sure. Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It's true! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?<br>
<i>Cecilia</i><b title='↗definitely, absolutely'>Certainly</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Would you slap me? Would you slap me <b title='exactly'>right</b> here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.)<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>God. You seem really, really nice.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, bye-bye.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I mean n-not-not fake at all like most <b title='↗celebrity, star'>famous people</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, <b title='We (Monica and Rachel. including Joey out of politeness or because he is part of the action) go here'>here we go</b>. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more-more thing. (To Cecilia) Umm, you're a stupid <b title='an unpleasant woman'>bitch</b>.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>I really can't slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You are so beautiful.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nice to meet you! My God, you're great!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thanks for <b title='stop by - make a short visit ↗come by'>stopping by</b>. <b title='See you later'>See ya</b>! (<b title='throw out - make sb leave a place ↗kick out'>Throws them out</b> and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I...<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Oh no-no-no-no, being <b title='adore - like/love very much ↗admire'>adored</b>. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>They sent me today's script! They never send me the script!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>They don't?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have <b title='words that an actor say in a film etc'>lines</b>! (Realizes what that means.) Oh...<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>How does it happen?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Ah what?! Jessica <b title='hate - dislike very much'>hates</b> horses!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to <b title='like sth very much'>be crazy about</b> electricity either.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica have gathered to hear Ross perform his <b title='a way of performing a piece of music etc ↗gig'>interpretation</b> of Celebration by Kool and the <b title='group of people'>gang</b> on the bagpipe.</s>
<i>Ross</i>...now remember you have to imagine me in a <b title='a type of traditional Scottish clothing, similar to a skirt, worn by men [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilt">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Kilted-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Kilted.jpg/220px-Kilted.jpg">'>kilt</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='giggle - laugh in a silly way because you are amused, embarrassed or nervous'>giggles</b>) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short <b title='a pattern consisting of crossed horizontal and vertical bands in two or more colours in woven cloth. Common examples of plaid patterns [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_%28pattern%29">Wiki</a>] ↗plait, checkers, stripes, polka dots'>plaid</b> skirt and knee socks.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Rachel) You wanna start telling secrets?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(stands up) Now umm, remember, I'm still learning.<br>
(As he prepares to start, he makes several horrible noises that scares Rachel into <b title='↗recoil, grimace, wince'>retreat</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>One, two, three, four!<br>
(He starts. And well, Celebration was never meant to be played on the bagpipe, so even the best bag pipeplayers in the world would have trouble with that particular song. So of course, for a beginner like Ross, it sounds absolutely <b title='very unpleasant =terrible'>dreadful</b>. The <b title='↗assemblage, auditorium, assembly line'>assembled</b> audience <b title='without ↗pluss'>minus</b> Phoebe, are horrified. Phoebe, <b title='↗vaccine, virus, bacteria'>immune</b> to bad music, seems to enjoy it.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know the song! Sing <b title='together'>along</b>!<br>
(Ross resumes playing, this time accompanied by Phoebe screeching out E's in tune with Ross. While Phoebe is singing along, Rachel is having a very difficult time keeping <b title='if you have a straight face, you are not laughing or smiling even though you would like to'>a straight face</b>. Both Ross' bagpipe playing and Phoebe's singing are shortened in the edited episode. Thankfully, Ross gives up after a little while.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So?<br>
<i>Monica and Chandler</i>No!<br>
(Ross throws the bagpipes down in <b title='a strong feeling of dislike or disapproval'>disgust</b>.)
<s>Silvercup Studios. Cecilia is watching the scene where Dina and Fredrick are celebrating Jessica's horrible accident by drinking champagne on the monitor as they are <b title='shoot - take photographs or make a film of sth'>shooting</b> the scene.</s>

And the electric fence, <b title='very special or impressive'>inspired</b>.<br>
<i>Fredrick</i>Thank you sweetheart. (They <b title='make or cause sth to make a sharp ringing sound'>clink</b> glasses.)<br>
<i>Dina</i>I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. (They move into kiss but; they're stopped by Joey entering with a huge <b title='↗cast, gauze, gurney'>bandage</b> wrapped around his head.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(as Jessica) I don't think so.<br>
<i>Dina</i>Who are you?!<br>
<i>Jessica Lockhart</i>What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own (Does a hair <b title='moving sth with a quick sudden movement '>flip</b>) mother?!<br>
<i>The Director</i>Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>(running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh noo...<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Well of course not, but you were very good.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thanks!<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>And guess what? Good news! I got another job!<br>

<i>Cecilia</i>Eight months.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, that's a really long time.<br>
<i>Cecilia</i>Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places <b title='↗up, north'>down</b> there.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well you know I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in <b title='New York City'>the city</b> first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a <b title='difficult to do or deal with, complicated'>tricky</b> one!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>He <b title='spring - move suddenly'>sprang</b> to his <b title='a vehicle which can slide over snow ↗sledge, sled, [<a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/52182/differences-between-sledge-sleigh-and-sled">difference</a>]'>sleigh</b>, to his team gave a <b title='a high sound made by blowing a whistle, or by blowing air out through the lips'>whistle</b>;<br>
and away they all flew like the <b title='the light fluffy part that flies away with the seed to spread the growth of the thistle [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061208121348AA4uV2X">link</a>]'>down of a thistle</b>; but I heard him exclaim, <b title='before'>ere</b> he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>(Smiling) <b title='[<a target=_blank href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas">A Visit from St. Nicholas</a>]'>Uh-huh</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>I can't believe you're not <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be here for Christmas.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're really not coming back?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be <b title='file - keep documents etc in a particular place'>filed</b> by the end of the year.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why can't those <b title='stupid'>dumb</b> Tulsa people do the work?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because those dumb people got everything <b title='dump sth on sb - unfairly give sb an unwanted job, duty, or problem to deal with'>dumped on</b> them by the <b title='behaving in a proud and superior manner ↗snobbish, patronize, smug, condescend, despise'>arrogant</b> <b title='jerk - sb who does things that annoy or hurt other people'>jerks</b> in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_york">Wiki</a>]'>New York</b> office. I'm caught between two worlds. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Just- It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, who does?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I like my job.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I love my job.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I can't wait to go back to work.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't get enough dinosaurs!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry, I won't be here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... <b title='=all right'>alright</b>, if this is what you have to do, I understand.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did I not mention that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Thinks for a second, then waves his arms, <b title='↗cry, shout'>exclaiming</b>) and to all a good night! (and runs out of the apartment)
<s>Chandler's Office in Tulsa, in the conference room.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but <b title='used to tell sb that their behavior is wrong and unnecessary'>there's no call</b> (he takes it off) for writing "<b title='fuck'>Screw</b> you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) By the way, you can all call me Chandler.<br>
(Wendy enters the conference room, carrying a cardboard box.)<br>
<i>Wendy</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Others</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey. Where've you been?<br>
<i>Wendy</i>I was, uh, <b title='check out - look at'>checking out</b> that insurance company's Christmas party on <b title='3rd floor'>three</b>, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just thought, to hell with them, we have to work. So I stole their ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.<br>
<i>Claudia</i>My kid's in a play <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) Had a little talk with the boys in New York, told <b title='them'>'em</b> about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may <b title='be correct/right'>be in order</b>.<br>
<i>Ken</i>(reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Pas_de_deux_01.jpg/120px-Pas_de_deux_01.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet">Wiki</a>]'>Ballet</b>".<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, that's like money in your pocket! Alright look, you want me to say it? This <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>. Being here sucks! This work sucks!<br>
<i>Wendy</i>Now, it feels like Christmas.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very <b title='not likely to be good ↗dubious, doubtful'>questionable</b> <b title='a cover for a bed that goes on top of all the other covers ↗covers, sheet, bedclothes, comforter, duvet, quilt'>bedspread</b>. <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b> tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, which, by the way, none of you, have invited me to.<br>
<i>Ken</i>You can come to my house!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Haha, no thanks!<br>
<i>Wendy</i>That was a nice <b title='a short speech intended to encourage sb to work harder, win a game etc ↗pep rally'>pep talk</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a <b title='giving motivation (eagerness and willingness to do sth)'>motivational</b> speaker.<br>
<i>Wendy</i>So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Typical Christmas<b title='having a quality/feeling'>-y</b> <b title='things'>stuff</b>, you know? Our holidays are <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> traditional.

Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.<br>

Said all you need is to write them a song.<br>

No, don't sing along.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. Chandler, why don't you <b title='↗go for a walk'>take a walk</b>? This doesn't concern you.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No, not ok, you can't look for Monica's presents!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, we have to!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, you don't have to, and you can't, because I, I live here too.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, then, you should look with us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I have a great idea for a present for her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, <b title='used to ask if sth has ended'>that's it?</b> (<b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mimic, mock, mime, simulate'>Mimics</b> Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.<br>

And you've just <b title='get_got_got/gotten'>gotten</b> her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If I help, we can find 'em faster!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's right!<br>
(Phoebe looks under the couch)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, ooh, we have a <b title='of current interest or relevance'>live</b> one!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Right. So, I'm sorry, but-<br>
<i>Wendy</i>Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was... happy?<br>

<i>Monica</i>I think you're better than you think you are.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Really? Ok, so...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Interrupting) Know when to stop.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around) Don't do the dance.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Right!<br>

[The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. {<a target=_blank href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://voices.yahoo.com/wedding-traditions-ideas-something-old-borrowed-364753.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://voices.yahoo.com/wedding-traditions-ideas-something-old-borrowed-364753.html%27" tppabs="http://voices.yahoo.com/wedding-traditions-ideas-something-old-borrowed-364753.html">Wedding Tradition</a>}<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, all right, all right, all right! Ok! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Ok, here's something, here's something blue and new. <br>
<i>Monica</i>You're so efficient. I love you!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let's go! (Starts to leave.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no-no, wait! We need something old!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, ok, I have a condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That'll <b title='as sth old'>work</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='as contraception (birth control)'>I don't think so</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, now we just need something borrowed!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the <b title='↗pullover, jumper'>sweater</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's stealing!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We'll, we'll bring it back! Just, put it under your dress.<br>
(She does so and it makes her look pregnant.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)<br>

[Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Listen, umm, I've been thinking, and, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you work for that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, I thought about it too, and, I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You do?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I'm <b title="put sb's foot down - say very firmly">putting my foot down</b>. Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you're so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and <b title='things'>stuff</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, you know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You thought about that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How many kids were we gonna have?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, four, a boy, <b title='↗triplet'>twin</b> girls and another boy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What else did you think about?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, stuff like where we'd live, you know? Like a, small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. You know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Laughs) You know what? I-I don't want a big, <b title='fashionable, expensive'>fancy</b> wedding.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure you do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You sure?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-hmm.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I love you so much.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you. (They kiss.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's Apartment, everyone except Chandler is there; they're opening their presents.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(Opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really? You're not gonna return it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, not this second!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(At the window) Hey, look, you guys, it's snowing!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw.<br>
(The others all get up and go to the window.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, wow, it's so beautiful...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wow, it really is!<br>
(They all stand a moment in silence, staring out of the window.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>"Wendy" is a fat girl name.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Aren't we done with that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, fine. Let's talk about snow. Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a <b title='=copy machine, photocopier, copier ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox">Xerox</a>]'>copying machine</b>?<br>
(Shortly after that, Chandler enters.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
(Surprised, <b title='utter - say'>uttering</b> Ahhs and Ohhs, the others are coming over to him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my god...<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas <b title='a wonderful and surprising event that is believed to be caused by God'>miracle</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you doing here?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='I understand'>Gotcha</b>. (<b title='↗wink'>blinks</b> an eye)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I never wanna leave you again!<br>
<i>Monica</i>But I thought if you left, you get fired.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='turn out - end up, prove to be'>Turns out</b> they can't fire me. Because I quit.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, you, you really quit your job?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he really wants to do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What do you really wanna do?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Realizing) I have not <b title='think sth through - think carefully about the possible results of sth'>thought this through</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my god!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know, I, I should've talked to you first about it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could've ever imagined.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Flattered) Ahh...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Now give me my real gift.<br>
(Chandler hands Phoebe an envelope, and some more to Monica)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(To Chandler) Thank you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) Here, pass these there (points to the others)<br>
(Monica passes the Envelopes on to Ross, Joey and Rachel.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, hey...<br>
(They all open their envelopes.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." How did you know?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I... thought it was <b title='occurring at just the right time ↗timing'>timely</b> we start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Mine's is to Lilian Myers.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't have a job!
<s>Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica is cleaning up, Chandler is sitting on the couch, checking the Job offers in a Newspaper.</s>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='sb who is employed by insurance companies to calculate how much they should charge their clients for insurance ↗accuracy'>Actuary</b>... no. <b title='sb who records the accounts or transactions of a business'>Bookkeeper</b>, um no. Topless dancer (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (To Monica) Hey, you know what I just realized? You, are the sole <b title='salary'>wage</b> earner. You are the head of the <b title='↗house, domestic'>household</b>. I, don't do anything.

(Chandler looks at the bill, thinking... then looks at the offer in the Newspaper and makes some dancing moves to see if he's <b title='being considered for'>up for</b> the job)<br>

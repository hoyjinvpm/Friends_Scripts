<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='freak out - become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaking out</b>) Oh, my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no-no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to my mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas, to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you could put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of <b title='a firm black substance with a strong taste. used for making candy and medicines [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquorice">Wiki</a>]'>licorice</b>, and takes a bite.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No reason, except... she... told... me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're sure? You're absolutely sure?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, no. But, um, <b title='used to say you are sure sth is true'>I bet</b> she probably does.<br>

(He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would've worked this time, if his hands weren't so <b title='used for emphasis'>damn</b> small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing <b title='exactly'>right</b> there) Ho, ho, ho!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I will have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I never thought I<b title='would'>'d</b> say.<br>
[They walk to the kitchen; everyone is lowering their voices]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Chandler) What're you doing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from <b title='↗co-worker, coworker, colleague'>a guy at work</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you, but, but you-you gotta leave.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're <b title='wreck - spoil, dmage, ruin'>wrecking</b> it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But I didn't <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> shake my <b title='↗stomach, abdomen, abs, belly button (navel)'>belly</b> like a bowl full of <b title='a soft, colored sweet food [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin_dessert">Wiki</a>]'>jelly</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry, Chandler, but this, this is really important to me. Ok?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fine, I'll give the suit back.<br>
[Ross turns around and walks back to Ben.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Chandler) Hey, you think you can keep it another night?

<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then it's ok! (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, Ben, Santa has to go. Say goodbye!<br>
<i>Ben</i>No! Why does he have to go?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because, if Santa and the Holiday... Armadillo? (Ross nods) ... are <b title='at any time'>ever</b> in the same room for too long, the universe will <b title='burst or explode inwards ↗collapse, Soviet Union, USSR'>implode</b>. Merry Christmas!<br>
<i>Ben</i>No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?<br>
<i>Ben</i>Ok, Santa!<br>
(Ross <b title='mouth - move your lips as if you were saying sth, but without making a sound'>mouths</b> to Chandler, "Thank you," and he mouths, "You're welcome," back.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.<br>
[Joey enters in a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Wiki</a>]'>Superman</b> costume]<br>

<i>Rachel</i>(yelling from another room) Oh my God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(returning) Ok, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother <b title='build'>put up</b> that wall to make that into two bedrooms?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>It left! It's one huge room!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>See?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You can't, because of the new <b title='a window in the roof admitting daylight'>skylight</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>There's a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(returning slowly) You know, I'm-I'm <b title='if you sense sth, you feel that it exists or is true ↗aura, atmosphere, sensation'>sensing</b> that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah? Starting to feel her again there are we?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>A little bit, yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You heard her too?! You have the <b title='talent'>gift</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe, it's ok. I like living with Joey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh me too.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. (They <b title='↗snuggle, embrace, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm getting something from your grandmother, she said that <b title='because, as'>since</b> you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh no, wait a minute. Oh ok, she didn't say chair, she said share. You should share the one-bedroom apartment.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh the purple chair! No yeah I heard that, yeah.
<s>Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Santa (Chandler), Superman (Joey), Ben, and Monica are listening to the Holiday Armadillo (Ross) finish telling the story of Hanukkah.</s>
<i>Ross</i>...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've lasted just one day, burned for...<br>
<i>Ben</i>(answering him) Eight whole days.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.<br>
<i>Ben</i><b title='very impressive, good, enjoyable etc ↗awe, awful'>Awesome</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who's nodding.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>The Armadillo was actually not so <b title='very excited, happy, and pleased ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller">Thriller</a>]'>thrilled</b> about that part!<br>
(Monica kisses Chandler)<br>
<i>Ben</i>(To Ross) Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because Aunt Monica was very... very good this year.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the <b title='a traditional Jewish candlestick that holds seven or nine candles'>menorah</b> to light the candles.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering with Phoebe) Hey!<br>

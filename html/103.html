<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hi guys!<br>
<i>All</i>Hey, Phoebe! Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it <b title='happen/develop'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Um, not so good. He <b title='walk sb to sth - walk somewhere with sb'>walked</b> me to the subway</b> and said 'We should do this again!'<br>
<i>All</i>Ohh. <b title='used for expressing a feeling of sudden pain'>Ouch</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, no. <b title='loose - not exact or thoroughly done'>Loosely</b> translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Since when?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Since always. It's like <b title='date - romantic meeting'>dating</b> language. You know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be dating leather-wearing <b title='alcoholic - sb who regularly drinks too much alcohol and has difficulty stopping'>alcoholics</b> and complaining about them to you'.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, or, you know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And everybody knows this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah. <b title='cushion the blow/impact (of sth) - protect sb from an unpleasant situation or the unpleasant effects of sth'>Cushions the blow</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh, Ross.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Connecticut_in_United_States.svg/270px-Connecticut_in_United_States.svg.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut">Wiki</a>]'>Connecticut</b>? The Millners, they had this <b title='↗amazing, incredible'>unbelievable</b> farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- ...Oh my God, Chi Chi!
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is helping Joey <b title='practice a play etc'>rehearse</b> for a <b title='role/character'>part</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>So how does it feel knowing you<b title='if sb is about to do sth, or if sth is about to happen, they will do it or it will happen very soon'>'re about to</b> die?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='sb in charge of a prison ↗con'>Warden</b>, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, that was really good!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah? Thanks! Let's keep going.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. "So. What do you want from me, <b title='a name. not "daemon or demon /&#039;di:mən/"'>Damone</b>? Huh?"<br>
<i>Joey</i>I just <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go back to my <b title='a small room in a prison or police station where prisoners are kept'>cell</b>. <b title='because'>'Cause</b> in my cell, I can smoke.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Smoke <b title='freely; at will: "Fire away!"'>away</b>.<br>
(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a <b title='a small device for providing a flame for a cigarette etc'>lighter</b>. He <b title='fumble - do sth awkwardly ↗fiddle, grope'>fumbles</b> and drops the lighter. Then he lights a cigarette, takes a <b title='the act of breathing in smoke from your cigarette'>drag</b>, and coughs.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Relax your hand! <b title='let go - stop holding'>Let your wrist go</b>.<br>
(Joey lets his wrist go <b title='not firm or strong ↗lame'>limp</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not so much!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, now try taking a <b title='the action of taking the smoke from a cigarette ↗huff'>puff</b>.<br>
(Joey tries and visibly <b title='wince - show pain briefly and suddenly in the face'>winces</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Right. Ok. No, give it to me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.<br>
(Joey <b title='slowly and unwillingly'>reluctantly</b> gives him the cigarette.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying ">now</b>, don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that<b title='has'>'s</b> been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.<br>
<i>Joey</i>You miss it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='no'>Nah</b>, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler give me that. (starts chasing him into the kitchen)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no, you got your <b title='choices'>options</b>. You can smoke it like this (demonstrates).<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Or you can hold it in your mouth and smoke it like this (demonstrates).<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler, give me the cigarette. Give me it, give me it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(gives Joey the cigarette) All right you try.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thank you. Ok, how's this? (takes another drag).<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, that's not bad. All right, now when you're finished it's really cool if you <b title='make sth move quickly and suddenly'>flick</b> it. You <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> flick it. You flick it. (Joey does do) That's good. Alright you keep practicing and uh-I'll go <b title='make a fire etc stop burning =extinguish (The cigarette set the sofa on fire.)'>put out</b> the <b title='=couch'>sofa</b>.
<s>Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>I thought it had to do with size of a guy's feet.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.<br>
(The guys stretch out their fingers.) (They're talking about the length of a man's penis.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's ridiculous!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Can I use.. either thumb?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(comparing the size of his foot with his stretched fingers) I'd rater to <b title='accept'>go with</b> the foot theory.<br>

(The <b title='a group of people'>gang</b> swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters. She sits down without saying hi.)
<i>Joey</i>You ok, Phoebe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What did they do to you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's nothing, it's just- Ok. I'm <b title='go through - read'>going through</b> my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, <b title='a record showing amounts of money paid, received, owed etc'>STATEMENT</b><br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yes, <b title='because'>'cause</b> now I have to go down there, and deal with them.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What're you talking about? Keep it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Ok, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, ok, and, and skipping- I'd hear, 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...<br>
<i>Monica</i>We're <b title='agreeing with / supporting'>with</b> you. We <b title='get - understand'>got</b> it.<br>
(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant <b title='karma - the belief that all the good and bad things that you do in this life affect how good or bad your future lives will be, according to the Hindu and Buddhist religions [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karmic">Wiki</a>]'>karmic</b> debt.<br>

<i>All</i>Oh! Oh, God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What is this?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>And this- is my <b title='sth that you get because you have done sth good or helpful or have worked hard ↗award, prize, benefit, bonus'>reward</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='wait for a short time'>Hold on</b> <b title='a very short period of time ↗sec'>a second</b>, alright? Just think about what you <b title='go through - experience a difficult or unpleasant situation, feeling etc'>went through</b> the last time you <b title='stop doing sth, esp sth that is bad or annoying ↗give up'>quit</b>. Nah, you know what? Forget about you! Think about what we went through the last time you quit.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, so this time I won't quit!<br>
<i>All</i>Ohhh! Put it out!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)<br>

<i>All</i>Oh, come on!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. Not after what happened with Steve.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What're you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well, then can we meet him?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. Schhorry.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Joey-Joey. <b title='let sth go - stop worrying or thinking too much about sth'>Let it go</b>.
<s>Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're <b title='be all over - attack'>all over</b> him. I mean, they're like- <b title='coyote - a small dog-like wild animal which lives in North America <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Coyote_with_typical_hold_on_lamb.jpg/220px-Coyote_with_typical_hold_on_lamb.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote">Wiki</a>]'>coyotes</b>, picking off the weak members of the <b title='↗a school of fish, a wolf pack, a flock of sheep/goats/birds'>herd</b>.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Yeah, well you didn't know Chi Chi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you all promise?<br>
<i>All</i>Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?<br>
(Chandler <b title='to indicate a promise of sincerity or good intentions'>makes a 'Cross my heart' sign</b>. It starts to rain and he <b title='tap - hit lightly'>taps</b> on the window.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You can come in, but your <b title='cigarette'>filter-tipped little buddy</b> has to stay outside!<br>
(Chandler <b title='sulky - feeling angry and unhappy and not wanting to talk to anyone or be with other people ↗moody, edgy'>sulkily</b> picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)<br>
(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)<br>

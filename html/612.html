<i>Ross</i>Hey. <b title='Look at this'>Check this out</b>. you're not <b title='going to'>gonna</b> believe this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, Ross, we know they have magazines with pictures of naked women in them.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(quietly) Oh, don't tell him about the videos! (Chandler waves his hand as a sign.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I <b title='make up - produce sth by thinking'>made up</b> a joke and sent it in to <b title='an American men&#039;s magazine that features photographs of nude women as well as journalism and fiction. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy">Wiki</a>]'>Playboy</b>. They printed it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, they print jokes, uh, interviews, <b title='criticizing in a very strong, honest, and direct way'>hard-hitting</b> <b title='material written for publication in a newspaper or magazine or for broadcast.'>journalism</b>. It's not just about the pictures.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It didn't work on mom, it's not gonna work on us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(showing them the page) Oh oh here, check it out. It's-it's the first one, too.<br>
(They all laugh <b title='lacking interest'>indifferently</b>, except Chandler, who's a little angry.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I made that joke up.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh oh-oh, yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'<br>
(Rachel is looking at the magazine and laughing.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. <b title='used as an interjection'>Man</b>, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica, you-you remember me tell you that joke, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Seriously?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you tell a lot jokes!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But uh hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets <b title='approval or praise'>credit</b>, right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I guess.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey you guys.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? No no no, it's mine, it's my joke. You can call them, they'll tell you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's my joke.<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's my joke.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? What? You guys know they have naked <b title='chick - a young woman'>chicks</b> in there, right?

<i>Joey</i>Let's go watch it at your place.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no no, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> miss when there were <b title='very thin / very good, excellent, cool'>skinny</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey hey Chandler, Chandler, you know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What? No, I wanna watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable <b title='become'>go</b> <b title='not operating/operational'>out</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, that's <b title='an American cable TV network [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH-1">Wiki</a>]'>VH-1</b>. Ok, I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> tell you, the music these kids listen to today... It's like a lot of noise to me. I don't know...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Joey, why is your cable out?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>If you need money, woluld you please-please just let me loan you some money?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, ok? Look, I know things've been a little <b title='difficult to deal with or manage ↗tough'>tight</b> since Janine moved out. Oh, was she <b title='sexy'>hot</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Whoa ho.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know! But, look-look, I can handle it. All right? I can uh, listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(picks up the phone) Fine, you wanna see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(with phone to ear, <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly'>obviously</b> hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used for emphasizing that sth did not happen or exist ↗not really, no way'>Not so much</b>.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Rachel are on the couch looking at the Playboy magazine. When they hear someone coming, Monica goes to hide it under the sofa cushions.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='happy and relaxed because something bad has not happened'>relieved</b>) Oh, it's only you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wh-wh-what're you doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We are looking at a Playboy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I wanna look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). <b title='said when sth frightens or shocks you'>Yikes</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So do you think that these pictures- Are, are they trying to tell a story?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh oh yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, she's not gonna find them lying in the grass like that.<br>
(They flip through the pages to another picture.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the <b title='a large building on a farm in which hay and grain are kept'>barn</b>, lift up your shirt, and bend over?<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You see, now, see now, I would <b title='have a romantic relationship with =go out with'>date</b> this girl. She's <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b>, she's <b title='enjoying outdoor activities'>outdoorsy</b>, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.

<i>Monica</i>Ok, I got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(thinks) I don't know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Me neither.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Rachel.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't know. (Pause) Me neither.
<s>Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.</s>
<i>Joey</i>You know, you forget how many great songs <b title='the band mentioned before'>Heart</b> had.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracuda">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-3875_aquaimages-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/3875_aquaimages.jpg/220px-3875_aquaimages.jpg"> ↗bass, perch, carp, salmon, anchovy'>Barracuda</b> was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, you heard it, you <b title='↗cover'>repeated</b> it, so that must mean you wrote it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, you guys, with this joke. Well I gotta say, I know I <b title='crack up - laugh hysterically ↗unrestrainedly'>cracked up</b>, but I'm not even sure I <b title='understood'>got</b> it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.<br>
(He and Chandler crack up.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And monkeys can't write out <b title='↗conscription, description, inscription, subscription, transcription'>prescriptions</b>.<br>
(He and Ross crack up again. Joey just sits there)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Your joke? Well, I think <b title='Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hefner">Wiki</a>]'>'the Hef'</b> would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, I was gonna <b title='put sth somewhere quickly and without much care'>stick</b> it in the <b title='Automaic Teller Machine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM">Wiki</a>] Cheque/Cash Acceptance, where the ATM accepts and recognise cheques and/or currency...'>ATM</b>, but now I think I'll show the sexy <b title='sb whose job is to receive and pay out money in a bank'>teller</b> that I am a published writer.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, she is gonna know that you stole the joke.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, what're you gonna do, follow me down there?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I'm not gonna go now anyway (he goes to sit down).<br>

<i>Gunther</i>(handing Joey the bill) <b title='Here you are'>Here you go</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this <b title='at the present time/immediately'>right now</b> <b title='because'>'cause</b> uh I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, paying for <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Well, if you want, you can work here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, I don't know. It's uh, it's just, see, I was a <b title='↗regular employee, part-time, intern'>regular</b> on a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera">Wiki</a>]'>soap opera</b>, you know? And, and to go from that to this, it is- I just... And <b title='used to add more information'>Plus</b> you know, I'd have to <b title='serve food and drink to'>wait on</b> all my friends.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Ok, but the money's good, plus you <b title='have the opportunity'>get to</b> stare at Rachel as much as you want.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?!<br>
<i>Gunther</i><b title='Flexible working hours. flexible - able to make changes or deal with a situation that is changing'>Flexible hours</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, they are in bed together.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to <b title='withdraw from'>back out of</b> it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(visibly upset) He-he took my joke, he did- he took it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm gonna have a joke <b title='a written record of what you have done each day ↗log, diary'>journal</b>. You know? And document the date and time of every <b title='used for emphasis'>single</b> one of my jokes.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's a good idea.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Eh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what's a bad idea?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Picking Rachel.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think it's coming from the living room.<br>
(They go out to investigate, and find Joey wrapped in a blanket watching their television.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='embarrassed because you know that you have done sth wrong or silly'>sheepishly</b>) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)
<s>Scene, Phoebe and Rachel's, they're sitting together on the couch.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(entering) Hey, you guys.<br>
<i>Phoebe and Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughing) Oh, don't you guys look <b title='interesting, attractive'>cute</b>. You guys make such a cute couple.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, what're you doing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughing harder) Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b>. (To Phoebe) Remember, when, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I guess it was kind of funny.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(angrily) It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why, why didn't you pick me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine. The reason that I was <b title='lean towards - tend / begin to support'>leaning a little bit more toward</b> Rachel than you is just, you know, you're... just... <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='demanding a great deal of attention, money, or effort'>high maintenance</b>. Ok let's go to lunch!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Ok, prove it. I want you to <b title='complete an official document by writing information on it'>write out</b> a list and we're gonna <b title='examine'>go through</b> it point by point!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, you're right. You're <b title='not easily upset, annoyed, or worried'>easy-going</b>. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. You know, she's just more flexible and-and <b title='calm and relaxed'>mellow</b>. That's all.<br>
(Monica stares at Rachel.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well you and- people are different.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. You know, you can just <b title='walk over - make sb do what you want them to do'>walk all over</b> her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? Wait a minute. What-what're you saying, that I'm a <b title='sb who is easily persuaded or influenced or defeated ↗sucker'>pushover</b>? I'm not a pushover.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, ok, (laughing) you're not a pushover.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh <b title='used when you are surprised, impressed, or upset'>my</b>... you think I'm a pushover. Well watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch. (She leaves)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)<br>
[Cut to the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b>.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I <b title='used when you are very surprised or shocked'>cannot believe</b> her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know. Where do you wanna go eat?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aww. Oh! I love that Japanese place.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uck, I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, wherever you wanna go is <b title='used to say that you agree with sth'>cool</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right.

(Gunther looks at the joke and laughs.)<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Yeah, that-that Chandler <b title='makes me laugh a lot'>cracks me up</b>.<br>
(Ross begins to say something, realizes what Gunther just said, turns, and glares at Chandler. Chandler just shrugs it off.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, Ross, listen uh, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heading</b> up there.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a 'what's wrong with you?' look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nah, nah, it's ok. Right, Gunther? (<b title='close and open one eye quickly'>Winks</b> at him as if they're in on a secret together.)<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Don't wink at me. And put on your <b title='a piece of clothing that you wear to protect the front of your clothes'>apron</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.<br>

<i>Ross</i>It's my joke.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's my joke.<br>
<i>Ross and Chandler</i>It's my joke.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, I don't think we're gonna settle this.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let's have Monica decide.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Mon.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Mon, get out here!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was <b title='summon - order sb to come to a place'>summoned</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, ok. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Why do I have to decide?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because you're the only one that can be fair.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah yeah, but I'm your brother. We're <b title='a group of people who are related to each other'>family</b>. That's the most important thing in the world.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Ross) Don't try to <b title='influence sb so that they change their opinion ↗hypnotize, anesthetize'>sway</b> her. (To Monica) (Softly) I'm your only chance to have a baby. Ok, let's go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, um, ok, we'll, we'll each tell you um, how we <b title='come up with - think of'>came up with</b> the joke <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> you decide which one of us is telling the truth- me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, you go first.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, I thought of the joke two months ago, at lunch with Steve.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, wait, is he the guy that I met at Christmas?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Can I finish my story?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you want me to pick you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>See, I would never <b title='say sth quickly and angrily ↗retort, talk back'>snap</b> at you like that.<br>
(Chandler <b title='motion - make a signal ↗gesture'>motions</b> to Monica that he'll give her two babies.)<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='↗go on, go ahead, proceed'>Continue</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing <b title='come up - happen'>came up</b>. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Are you kidding? Ok, look. I-I study evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not arguing with that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.<br>
(Both Chandler and Ross are eager to hear her decision.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>You are both <b title='↗moron, imbecile, retarded'>idiots</b>. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! All right, you-you shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for <b title='inflict - force sb to experience sth very unpleasant'>inflicting</b> this horrible joke upon the world! Now <b title='stop worrying or thinking too much about sth'>let it go</b>! The joke <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>!<br>
(Monica leaves the room)<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's your joke.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's not.
<s>Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at a table and Phoebe is on the couch. Chandler and Monica can be seen outside, she's <b title='lecture - talk angrily or seriously to sb ↗preach, breach'>lecturing</b> him, and pushes him inside. He then nods to Rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then Monica makes a <b title='very impressive'>grand</b> entrance.</s>
<i>Monica</i>My God, Chandler, there you are.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi, oh hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Hey, why don't you tell them um, what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?<br>
(Rachel and Phoebe exchange looks.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(starts to <b title='say a piece of writing aloud from memory'>recite</b> a <b title='rehearse - practise a play etc'>rehearsed</b> speech) Monica is a <b title='able to provide all the things you need without help from other people'>self-sufficient</b>, <b title='confident, thinking clearly, and doing things in a sensible organized way'>together</b> lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be <b title='↗aware, observe, perception'>perceived</b> as high maintenance is <b title='↗only, just'>merely</b> attention to details and- (He <b title='falter - speak with pauses between the words, because you are nervous or upset ↗stammer, stutter, fluent'>falters</b> and Monica <b title='prompt - help a speaker who pauses, by suggesting how to continue'>prompts</b> him.) <b title='<a href="http://www.docdreyfus.com/psychologically-speaking/generosity-of-spirit/">People who are generous of spirit are genuinely happy for others good fortune irrespective of their own circumstances.</a>'>generosity of spirit</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? I've heard better.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You're a little high maintenance.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ahhh! You, are on my list.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry. But you're not, you're not easy-going, but you're-you're <b title='believe sth very strongly; like sth a lot'>passionate</b>, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good, at making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's ok, because I like... <b title='maintain - look after'>maintaining</b> you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn't even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right, you're off my list.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(happily) I'm off the list. (Sits on the couch.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(sits next to him) Phoebe, it's ok that you don't want me to be your girlfriend, because I have the best boyfriend.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Monica) You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.<br>
(Joey enters.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, <b title='[<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101125195119AAofD7Y">link</a>]'>buddy boy</b>, how'd the audition <b title='happen'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, not good, no. I- I didn't get the part, and uh, I lost my job here, so...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! That is a bad audition.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>How-how did you lose your job here?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, I had the audition, but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went <b title='in spite of the fact that you have just mentioned'>anyway</b>, and then he fired me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal <b title='a short trip / a small job'>errand</b> and left you in charge when you've been working here for two days? That's not, that's not right.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, what're you gonna do?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Joey, you can't let him <b title='not be caught or punished when you have done sth wrong'>get away with</b> that. Well you know what, I'm not gonna let him get away with that. I'm gonna say something to him- No, I really shouldn't say anything- No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>He can have his job back.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's right, he can have his job back. Glad we got that all <b title='straighten out - deal with problems or a confused situation and make it better'>straightened out</b>. <b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb'>There you go</b>, Joey, you got your job back.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's great. Thanks Rach.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(returning from the bathroom) Rach, you're in my seat.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm sorry. (Gets up and moves.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the kitchen table, talking.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, I never <b title='get to - have the opportunity to'>got to</b> hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw, I'd pick you, Phoebe.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, well, I kinda thought.<br>
(Phoebe gets up from the table, and while her back is turned, Rachel and Monica indicate via sign language that they each would have picked the other.)<br>
(Joey, Chandler and Ross enter.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh hey. Wait I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to <b title='have a romantic relationship with sb ↗ask out, date'>go out with</b>, who would you pick?<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to tell sb that sth is impossible ↗not really'>No way</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm not answering that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I'm not answering that.<br>

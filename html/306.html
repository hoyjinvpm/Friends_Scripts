<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. And you know what? If that doesn't change soon, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='end relationship =break up'>dump</b> you for somebody who <b title='put out - have sex willingly'>puts out</b>.<br>
<i>Janice</i><b title='expressing disbelief'>Come on</b> over the years none of you ever got, you know, drunk and stupid?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh, then it must've been you. Bye. (Leaves)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That's why I moved out.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, you know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I think on some levels she already knows.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Phoebe, she doesn't know that you <b title='go secretly ↗sneaker, stealth, slink, creep'>sneak</b> out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living in your Grandmother's for a week now.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, well maybe not on those levels.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You have got to tell her. Ok? The longer you wait the harder it's gonna be on her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're right, you're right. (Grabs her bag) Anyway, listen..umm...tonight's bag is really <b title='too big to be carried or stored easily'>bulky</b> so you could sneak some <b title='things'>stuff</b> out for me?

<i>Ross</i>So how many more do you have tomorrow?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Two. This photographer, who seemed really <b title='boring'>dull</b>. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Phoebe) Sure, your <b title='a piece of bedroom furniture with a lot of drawers =chest of draweres'>dresser</b> is missing but this she notices.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yes, it is cool. Because I have models here, you know...never. What else?<br>
<i>Eric</i>Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a <b title='pornography -

<i>Ross</i>My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no! Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>'Cause Carol's a lesbian. (Phoebe is <b title='↗stunned, astonish, astound, dumbfounded'>shocked</b>) And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a <b title='combine things that are not related'>mix and match</b> situation.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Maybe this wouldn't 've happened if I'd been more <b title='nuture - provide care and attention ↗nourish, nutrient'>nurturing</b>, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a <b title="the organ in a woman's body where babies grow =womb">uterus</b>. I can't believe it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. No, no, you know you don't deserve this, you don't, Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good. (Kisses him on the cheek)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Thanks. (Kisses her on the lips)<br>
(They pause, <b title='used to say what happens next'>and then</b> they start kissing passionately, and taking off each others clothes, and then they start to lie down on the pool table.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, come here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh?<br>
(Ross tries to clear off the pool table by knocking the balls to the other end of the table, but they all bounce back, and he <b title='↗hysterical'>frantically</b> starts to throw them into the pockets.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
(Phoebe jumps on to the table and lays down, Ross follows her and hits his head on the light hanging over the pool table.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh. (They start kissing again)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>My foot is stuck in the pocket.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>

(They both look at each other and start laughing (<b title='Phoebe'>Lisa Kudrow</b> almost <b title='lose it - start laughing or crying and be unable to stop'>lost it</b> there), and sit up. Ross hits his head on the lamp again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh well. It probably wouldn't 've been the most constructive solution.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You've chalk on your face.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Em? (The rest of the gang enters)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought <b title='pool table'>this</b> was real grass.<br>

<i>Monica</i>I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(with no hesitation) Sex!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Phoebe) It's like a giant <b title='↗embrace, cuddle, huddle, snuggle'>hug</b>.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that <b title='boring'>dull</b> just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into a car with her!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Hey! Hi, sweetie. Hey, you smell like perfume and cigarettes. <br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was in the car with Nancy all day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nancy doesn't smoke!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So? What do you think of the house?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Isn't it? Then what about the-the amazing <b title='wainscot - the bottom part of the walls in a room, esp when it is covered with wood =baseboard'>wainscotting</b> and the <b title='mold - give sth a particular shape or form. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Wilkenson_154.jpg/220px-Wilkenson_154.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_molding">Wiki</a>]'>crown molding</b> and the <b title='a dormer or dormer window is a window that is built upright in a sloping roof'>dormer windows</b> in the <b title='the top floor of a house, directly under the roof'>attic</b>? <br>

<i>Monica</i>Don't you love the huge yard?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And the <b title='a place in a room where you can make a fire'>fireplace</b> in the bedroom.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And Nancy said that it's really <b title='lower than the real, normal, or appropriate value ↗bargain, haggle, discount, on sale'>underprice</b>, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>This is <b title='bring out - cause to be seen'>bringing out</b> a lovely color in you!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I don't know. What do you think?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I think we should.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I do too.<br>
<i>Monica</i>This is huge!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>How <b title='to a great or serious degree =badly'>bad</b> you wanna smoke right now?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='I understand'>Gotcha</b>. When do we tell them about this?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Right. Oh my God, that is gonna be so hard.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. Gooooood luck with it.
<s>Joey's apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.</s>
<i>Ross</i>I just can't <b title='understand, imagine'>see</b> Chandler <b title='cheat - have sex with sb who is not your husband, wife, or partner'>cheating</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling</b> you guys, we followed them out to a house in <b title='Westchester County, New York [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York">Wiki</a>]'>Westchester</b>, they went in for like forty-five minutes <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> they came out looking <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> happy!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So you went all the way to Westchester, waited 45 minutes and came back in a cab?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. And if each of you guys would like to <b title='join others and pay part of the money towards sth ↗chip in'>pitch in</b> 100 <b title='dollars'>bucks</b>, that'll be great.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know, and with the baby coming?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, should we tell her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't know. Phoebe, if-if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why? Who'd you seen him with?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No one, I'm just saying if- (Phoebe starts <b title="pinch - squeeze sb's skin between your thumb">pinching</b> him in his neck)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was <b title='based on a situation that is not real, but that might happen ↗theoretical'>hypothetical</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Believe me, if I <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> see with someone, there's <b title='used to say you will definitely not do sth'>no way</b> I- (Phoebe starts pinching him again)<br>
<i>Phoebe </i>WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
<s>Monica's apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_buster">Wiki</a>]'>dustbuster</b>. The guys enter the room.</s>

<i>Monica</i><b title='used to express a strong wish, esp when you know that what you want cannot happen'>If only</b> there were a smaller one to clean this one!<br>

<i>Monica</i>No, he's <b title='pick up - buy sth or get it from a shop etc'>picking up</b> dinner, why, <b title="'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">what's up</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.<br>
<i>Monica (<b title='↗confused, bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>puzzled</b>)</i>All right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We think Chandler might be having an affair.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They went in together. So sorry.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?<br>
(They all look confused and sorry for her)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you-you understand what we're saying, right?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm <b title='feeling very shocked and upset'>devastated</b>, <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b>...

<i>Chandler</i>Is it me, or the greeting's <b title='go downhill - decrease in the quality, quantity, or importance of sth'>gone downhill</b> around here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who's Nancy?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(turns to them) Ok, <b title='=all right'>alright</b>, guys, you'd better sit down, this is, this is pretty big.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah (<b title='motion - give sb directions or instructions by moving your hand or head ↗signal, gesture'>motions</b> them to sit and they do) Uh, I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our <b title='real estate agent ↗listing/selling agent'>realtor</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why, why do you have a realtor?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uhm, she<b title='has'>'s</b> been showing us houses outside of the city.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(clearly shocked) What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Are you serious?<br>
<i>Monica</i>When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't wanna raise a kid in the city.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So, so you're gonna move?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Shouldn't we all <b title='↗ballot, election'>vote</b> on <b title='things'>stuff</b> like this?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jessica_Parker">Wiki</a>]'>Sarah Jessica Parker</b> is doing it!<br>
<i>Monica</i>And that's great for you guys, but we want a <b title='↗meadow'>lawn</b> and a <b title='a tall metal frame with swings hanging from it'>swing set</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can <b title='↗pass'>go by</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='saying things that are the opposite of what you mean. satire - the use of humor to criticize sb/sth and make them seem silly'>sarcastic</b>) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?<br>

<i>Joey</i>No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna <b title='hit sb very hard with your hand closed'>thump</b> you! (points his fist at him)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Joey) It's ok, because they have to <b title='get out - succeed in saying sth, esp when this is very difficult'>get it out</b> of their system, ok (back to Mon and Chan), but you're gonna realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.<br>
(Pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Actually, we already found a house we love.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>And about an hour ago, we made an offer.<br>
(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='I bet - used to say you are sure sth is true'>Bet</b> you wish I was having an affair now, huh?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Is-is this because I <b title="↗come by, drop by, stop by">come over</b> here without knocking and, and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can! <br>
<i>Chandler</i>(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)<br>
<i>Monica</i>We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It's-it's beautiful, isn't it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah it is.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What <b title='used to show that you are very surprised or angry'>the hell</b> are you doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is <b title='screw - have sex with'>screwing</b> this woman, but <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b> this would be a nice place to live!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but so is this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?<br>

<i>Ross</i>What, the hell, are you doing?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(running from the guy's apartment with Joey <b title='following closely behind'>in tow</b>) Hey, what's-what's going on?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='↗panic, mimicking'>panicking</b>) Dude! He's <b title='exactly'>right</b> there!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Look, we're not just <b title='mess around - have a sexual relationship with sb that you should not have a sexual relationship with'>messing around</b>! I love her. Ok, I'm in love with her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. Sorry, but it-it's true, I love him too.<br>
(There's a brief pause.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)<br>
(From <a href="606.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/606.html">The Last Night</a>)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, so funny, 'cause I was just gonna go across the <b title='corridor'>hall</b> and write that on Chandler.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you guys, I don't <b title='↗intend to, deliberate, on purpose'>mean to</b> make things worse, but umm, I don't wanna live with Rachel <b title='If sth does not happen or is not true anymore, it has stopped happening or is no longer true.'>anymore</b>.<br>
<i>Monica and Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're just so mean to each other! And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe, you gotta take her! You know, I, I know I said some really bad stuff about her, but you know Rachel does have some good qualities that make her a good <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate, roomie'>roommate</b>. She gets <b title='a lot of'>tons of</b> <b title='catalog - a list of all the things in a library, museum, exhibit, or sale'>catalogs</b> and umm, she'll fold on the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What else?<br>
<i>Monica</i>When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.<br>
<i>Monica</i>When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, you know what, I don't want you to be cold.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And, when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! (They both <b title='lose control, have a physical/mental collapse'>break down</b> in tears.)<br>
(Time lapse)<br>
(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel's old and now empty room.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She really left.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know. (He kisses her.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="used as a friendly answer when sb thanks you for sth you have done ↗you're welcome, sure, not at all">No problem</b> roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Can I ask you a question?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)<br>
(From <a href="109.html" tppabs="http://soncp.com/afs/109.html">Underdog Gets Away</a>)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Little <b title="an occasion when people all drink together and say sb's name in order to show their admiration or good wishes">toast</b> here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this's been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or <b title='forcible ejection of contents of stomach through the mouth. projectile - thrown forward'>projectile vomiting</b>. <b title='used when you are changing the subject of a conversation or returning to a previous subject'>Anyway</b>, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to <b title="Vail Ski Resort is the second largest ski mountain in North America (after Whistler Blackcomb).">Vail</b>, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have <b title='a very serious disease that is passed from one person to another during sexual activity ↗VD (venereal disease), [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis">Wiki</a>]'>syphilis</b> and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say, is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucked</b>.<br>
<i>All</i>That's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And hey, here's to a <b title='very bad'>lousy</b> Christmas.<br>

<s>We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. They're all still at the kitchen table.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>You can't move. You just... you just can't.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you guy- you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here, and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. So, so don't move, ok? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your <b title='a window cover that you pull down from the top to the bottom ↗drapes, curtain'>blinds</b> at night.<br>
(The phone rings and Chandler goes to get it)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And?<br>
(Chandler listens to what Nancy says)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Nancy) Ok, thanks. (to Monica) They <b title='pass - to not accept an invitation or offer ↗reject, turn down'>passed</b>. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We can't afford that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, <b title='used to say that nothing can be done to change an unsatisfactory situation'>there you go</b>.<br>
(Chandler and Monica hug)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm really sorry, you guys.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Monica) You're gonna be ok?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, we'll be ok.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive <b title='at an earlier time ↗then'>before</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's ok, we understand.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. And-and about this Nancy... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?<br>
(Chandler gives Joey her business card, which he eagerly <b title='↗snatch'>grabs</b> and he leaves.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We got the house.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I just didn't wanna tell you in front of them.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! My God! We've got the house?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We're getting the house! (they hug) We're getting the house.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And a baby.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We're growing up.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We sure are.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So who's gonna tell them?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(quickly) <b title='"Not it" exempts a person from performing a deed provided he or she is not the last person to call "not it". exampt - give sb permission not to do or pay sth'>Not it</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not it! Damn it!
<s>Central Perk. The entire <b title='group of people ↗flock, herd'>gang</b> is there, and Chandler and Monica are handing out presents.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, this is yours.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aah! Why? What're these for?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You'll see.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, everybody open them!<br>
(They all tear off the wrapping paper)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ooh! Oh, wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! These're the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh I love this. (he got a sweater)<br>
<i>Joey</i>A meatball <b title='a submarine sandwich'>sub</b>? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Seriously you guys, what's going on? What're these for?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Enjoy!<br>
(They both run off, leaving Ross, Phoebe and Rachel <b title='very shocked or upset'>stunned</b>.)<br>

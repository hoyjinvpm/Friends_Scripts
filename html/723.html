<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, he is more of a "if you've got it <b title='show sth so that other people notice it ↗show off'>flaunt</b> it" kind of... father.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.) I <b title='could have'>coulda</b> been worse!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. I'll be <b title='exactly'>right</b> there.<br>
(She exits and as Chandler <b title='pick up - lift'>picks up</b> his coat, the phone rings and the answering machine gets it.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>It-it's so great to see you both here.<br>
<i>Mr. Bing</i>Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Don't you have a little too much <b title='the organ on the body of a man or male animal, used for urinating and sex'>penis</b> to be wearing a dress like that?<br>

<i>Mr. Geller</i>Doctor Ross Geller.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Dad... dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the <b title='the friend who helps a bridegroom at his wedding'>best man</b>. And uh, I have to say, I'm uh, I'm a little surprised we are all here.. today. For those of you who don't know Chandler, uh, he's not the biggest fan of relationships. In fact, I think before he met Monica, the only real relationship he had was with a girl named Molly. And he would've married her, only uh she couldn't control her <b title="a part inside your body that is like a bag where urine collects before being passed from the body ↗pee, urinate, wet one's bed">bladder</b>. (Starts to laugh a little, but no one else does) (A pause ensues) It-it was his dog! Did I say it was his dog? Any-<b title='used when changing the subject of a conversation'>anyway</b>... uh, this marriage uh, is, is doubly special, for me, umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could <b title='expect/demand'>ask</b> for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass, to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.<br>
<i>All</i>To the Bings!<br>
(Everyone clinks glasses and Chandler freaks out again.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are in the kitchen.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>How cool is this? The next time you see Chandler you're gonna be walking down the <b title='a passage between rows of seats in a church, theater, train etc'>aisle</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe that after tomorrow, it's all gonna be over.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh honey. It's not gonna be over; you're gonna be married to Chandler.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. Oh! Maybe I can wear the dress for <b title='a yearly celebration observed in a number of countries on October 31 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Wiki</a>]'>Halloween</b>! (Phoebe nods) All right, I'm gonna go <b title='↗iron'>steam</b> my wedding dress ok? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'll do it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Who wants it? Anybody?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I said I'll do it!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica! I'm not gonna <b title='screw up - ruin, spoil'>screw it up</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry. Yeah actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well of course that is what I'm here for!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nice <b title='sunglasses'>shades</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Thanks. Yeah, I <b title='think'>figure</b> if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in my eyes, you know?<br>
<i>Ross</i>And if I remember correctly, <b title='an American brand of sunglasses and eyeglasses founded in 1937 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban">Wiki</a>]'>Ray-Ban</b> was the official <b title='a person or business that pays money to support an event etc'>sponsor</b> of World War I!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See <b title='you'>ya</b>. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(going up to Rachel's closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesn't see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesn't find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Chandler just left <b title='used as an intensive ↗interjection, exclamation, emphasis, stress'>though</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I... drank the last of the milk. Or-or, tell Monica I'm sorry I used her <b title='a small piece of equipment made of two narrow strips of metal joined at one end <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Tweezers-variety.jpg/400px-Tweezers-variety.jpg">'>tweezer</b> to <b title='pull sth quickly in order to remove it ↗yank, tug'>pluck</b> my nose hair. He does that, I've seen him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, no, maybe, maybe he, he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, you know? Tell Monica I'm Sorry.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I think it means he freaked out and left!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't be so <b title='considering only the bad qualities of a situation ≠positive ↗optimistic'>negative</b>! <b title='used for emphasis'>Good God</b>! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel's apartment) <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. Phoebe, I-I- I think Ross is right. What're we gonna do?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look- Ok, I'm just gonna- I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Ok? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(pointing at Ross) But, if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt YOU down and kick YOUR ass!<br>
(Ross laughs and Phoebe points harder.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(scared) I will, I will find him.<br>
(Ross leaves as the girls <b title='go in particular direction'>head</b> back to the apartment)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well the dress is done. (Thinks something is wrong with Phoebe and Rachel) What? (Phoebe and Rachel look at each other)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We're, we're just so happy for you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. Hey, can we just take a minute and talk about the man that I'm gonna marry tomorrow? I mean, how lucky am I?<br>

Oh, great hat. (He's wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen, umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?<br>
<i>The Priest</i>I don't know. Are, are they Greek <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church">Wiki</a>]'>Orthodox</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! Yeah. They're... they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidophilis (this is the correct way to spell the last name).
<s>Monica's Hotel Room, Chandler and Monica's parents and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>I thought he was with you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>He-he was with me, umm, we're playing a little game, you know? Hide and seek.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>You can't ask us son, that's cheating.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pause) You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Well, he'd better not <b title='↗come over, stop by'>come by</b> here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>As I <b title='remember ↗recollection'>recall</b> when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.<br>
<i>Mr. Bing</i>But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Honey, it isn't good luck.<br>
(Monica enters.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, my God! Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! Hey, how's Chandler doing?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you're-you're sweating.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Out of happiness for you and Chandler. These-these are beads of joy.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, Phoebe, can I see you for a second?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
(They both go out into the hall.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What's going on?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chandler's gone again!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a <b title='a term most commonly used by lawyers when trying to convince a judge that the defendant might leave the country to avoid punishment if they were let out on bail'>flight risk</b>?!<br>
(Ross just glares at her.)
<s>The Movie Set, Joey is walking up to the director, <b title='plead - beg'>pleading</b> with him to let him go.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's <b title='very drunk ↗wasted, tanked, drunken'>hammered</b>!<br>
<i>The Director</i>I'm sorry Joey, <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> he's here and he's conscious, we're still <b title='↗record, shot'>shooting</b>.<br>
(He walks away and Joey does Ross's fist thing. He then enters Richard's dressing room, to find Richard cutting his steak with his sword.)<br>
<i>Richard</i>You wouldn't <b title='by chance ↗coincidence'>happen to</b> have a very big fork?<br>
<i>Joey</i>So I uh, I just talked to the director. <b title='used to say that sth has ended'>That's it</b>, we're done for the day.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Well have we finished the scene?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! You...you were wonderful.<br>
<i>Richard</i>As were you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>So I get your car, it's right outside.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Why? Are we done for the day?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's what you told me.<br>
<i>Richard</i>Oh, thank you. You're welcome. (He stands up, <b title='stagger - walk or move unsteadily, almost falling over =stumble ↗stammer'>staggers</b> to the couch, and starts to lie down.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>No-no-no-no! We gotta go! Hey, come on!

<s>The Hotel, Phoebe and Ross are looking for Chandler.</s>

<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
(Ross runs over and <b title='tackle - force sb to the ground'>tackles</b> him.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! Oh!<br>
<i>Ross</i>You're not getting away this time, mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ross! (He starts to get up.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I know about Monica.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! What?! Talking about what?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You don't know?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Know what- If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? You'll hi-ya?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica's pregnant.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...<br>
<i>Phoebe and Ross</i>Cigarettes?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='the situation considered as a whole'>Big picture</b> please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby <b title='a knitted woollen or cotton piece of clothing for the upper part of the body, with long sleeves and no buttons ↗sweater, pullover'>jumper</b> that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah, you know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well you <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> didn't see <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d3/Childsplay3.jpg/220px-Childsplay3.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Play_%28film_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Chucky Three</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So, I got it to give Monica so she'd, know I was ok.<br>

<i>Mr. Bing</i>Our little boy is getting married.<br>
<i>Mrs. Bing</i>Oh look at you! So handsome!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I'm so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)<br>
(He walks up onto the <b title='a holy table in a church or temple'>altar</b> and notices the Priest.)<br>
<i>The Priest</i>Are you Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you Joey?<br>
(Ross walks down the aisle with Phoebe and Rachel on his arms.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh. This is nice.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.<br>
(Finally, Monica with her parents on her arms start down the aisle.)<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Oh I wish your grandmother'd lived to see this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's right there.<br>
<i>Mrs. Geller</i>Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on the cheek.) Congratulations darling.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>We love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)<br>
(Chandler steps off the altar to greet his <b title='↗mother-to-be'>bride-to-be</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title="Don't talk/think about that now">Not now</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok.<br>
(They both step up onto the altar and she notices the Priest.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) Who is this?<br>
<i>The Priest</i>I am <b title='the title of a priest, esp in the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church'>Father</b> Kalebasous.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(in Monica's ear) He's Greek Orthodox.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(leaning in) <b title='in the same way'>As</b> are you...<br>
<i>The Priest</i>Let us begin. Dearly <b title='loved very much'>beloved</b>...<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) That's my <b title='the words spoken by an actor etc'>line</b>! (He walks up the aisle and to the Priest) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be <b title='↗puzzled, bewildered, bemused'>confused</b> by this now, (He's still in costume) but you won't be <b title='a United States federal holiday which occurs every year on the final Monday of May. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day">Wiki</a>]'>Memorial Day</b> weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom <b title='take off - leave'>takes off</b> again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy <b title='marriage'>matrimony</b>. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, <b title='used to state the reason for sth'>as</b> I've left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the <b title='vow - a formal and serious promise'>vows</b>. Monica?<br>
(She turns to get her vows from Rachel.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Rachel) He took off?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, for so long I... I wondered if I would <b title='at any time'>ever</b> find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding, I <b title='turn to - go to sb for help, advice etc ↗go to'>turned to</b> a friend for <b title='if sb/sth gives you comfort, they make you feel calmer, happier, or more hopeful after you have been worried or unhappy ↗soothe, console'>comfort</b>. And instead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now... here we are... with our future before us... and I only wanna spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Chandler?<br>
(Ross leans in to give Chandler his vows.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) Nah, that's ok. (Ross nods and <b title='retreat - move back'>retreats</b>.) Monica I thought this was gonna be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's ok, because I will always love you. You are the person I <b title='↗fate, destiny, doom'>was meant to</b> spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers <b title='vest in - give sb the official right to do or own sth'>vested in</b> me by <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_york">Wiki</a>]'>the state of New York</b> and the Internet guys, I now <b title='officially state'>pronounce</b> you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah you do!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rings?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Aw <b title='shit ↗shoot'>crap</b>! Ok-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.<br>
(Chandler and Monica both turn, take the rings from Ross and Rachel <b title='in the same order as the people or things already mentioned ↗correspondinglyly'>respectively</b>, and place them on each other's fingers.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>We <b title='↗okay, all right, cool'>good</b>? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.<br>
(They kiss and everyone <b title='applaud - clap'>applauds</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What baby?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Our baby.<br>
<i>Monica</i>We have a baby?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I didn't take a pregnancy test.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then... who did?<br>
[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Look at them. Oh and they're gonna have a baby.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh.<br>
(The camera <b title='if a camera zooms in, it makes the person or thing that you are taking a picture of seem bigger and closer'>zooms in on</b> Rachel who has a very worried and frightened look on her face and she slowly takes a deep breath.)<br>

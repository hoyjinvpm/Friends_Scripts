<s>Chandler and Monica's apartment.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, we're leaving tomorrow and you still got a lot of packing to do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hmm, so Nancy told me about this-this job at this great restaurant, Javo. It's just a little outside of Tulsa.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well how far outside?<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">Wiki</a>]'>Manhattan</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And, you're thinking of <b title='take - accept'>taking</b> it? (Pause) So, <b title='at an earlier time ↗then, once'>before</b> you said being with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm gonna miss this hand! Ok, I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is just not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And, well, if we can't <b title='manage to deal with a difficult experience'>make it</b> one day, we got real problems my friend.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I-I think you should take the job.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start <b title='chatter - talk quickly and continuously ↗chirp'>chattering</b> like a monkey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, it's your dream job, I can't make you <b title='pass up - to not take advantage of an opportunity'>pass it up</b>. Besides, I'm-I'm proud of you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You are?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah. And when I get to Tulsa and people say, "Where's the <b title='wife ↗missus, Mrs'>missis</b>", l'll tell them "she's a chef at Javu." <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>And then</b>, when they stare at me blankly, l'll make some offensive Tulsa joke, and thus begin my <b title='the state of being separated from other people, or a situation in which you do not have the support of other people'>isolation</b>.<br>
(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>How was the pediatrician?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, yeah, it was really, really, really good.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You promised you wouldn't say anything.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician! (To Ross) I don't care!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?<br>
<i>Ross</i>He's a brilliant <b title='a physician specializing in medical diagnostics'>diagnostician</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Diagnostician or <b title='a slight injury ↗boo-hoo'>boo-boo</b> fixer?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, seriously! You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> go to an appropriate doctor and not an <b title='a dentist whose job is to make teeth straight ↗Barry'>orthodontist</b>, not a <b title='↗ob/gyn, female reproductive organs'>gynecologist</b>, and not a <b title='a doctor for animals =vet ↗veteran'>veterinarian</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why? Why? I-I know it's a little weird, but hey, he is a great doctor, ok? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he <b title='↗make a big deal out of sth - treat sth as if it were very important'>makes a big deal</b>. You know, 'Ah, look, it's-it's my favorite patient!'<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Does he say that before he <b title='stick - push in'>sticks</b> his <b title='a piece of equipment that measures temperature'>thermometer</b> in your <b title='↗arse, ass, bottom, butt, buttock, tush, tushy, posetrior, stern, rear'>tushie</b>?<br>

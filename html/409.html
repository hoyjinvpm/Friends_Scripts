<i>Joanna</i>(Interrupting) Ok, but that would actually be a big step down for me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, <b title='in fact'>actually</b>, I meant for me. The hiring <b title='↗board, council, counsel'>committee</b> is meeting people all day and...<br>
<i>Joanna</i>Oh. Well, I <b title='↗hope'>wish</b> I could say no, but I guess you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>God, I am so glad that you don't have a <b title='↗issue'>problem</b> with this, because if you did, I wouldn't 've even considered applying.<br>
<i>Joanna</i>Really? Well, <b title='if that is the situation'>in that case</b>...<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ohh! That's great!<br>
<i>Joanna</i>You know, Junior Miss is where I started. I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Joanna</i>No-ho-ho! (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't wanna be the reason I'm unhappy.<br>

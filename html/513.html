<i>Monica</i>I can't believe we've never done this <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!<br>

<i>Monica</i>You know, I don't like to <b title='talk about your achievements or possessions in a proud way that annoys other people =boast ↗bluff, smug, gloat, strut'>brag</b> about it, but I give, like the best massages!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ah! Ahh! Ahh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So good, isn't it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Sorry.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(examining the hat) And the bunny <b title='get away - leave, escape'>got away</b>. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(glaring at Joey) This would be the <b title='the right occasion or time for sth'>place</b> where you explain the hat.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh. Ok. This is called a top hat. (<b title='change your expression to make people laugh or to show you are angry, disappointed etc'>Makes a face</b> like he couldn't believe Ross asked that question.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! Umm, well, only ok, <b title='because'>'cause</b> I just got back from, from the hospital.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's ok. Actually you know what, it's <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> cool. 'Cause it's like, you know, one life ends and another begins.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to the guys) Not the way they're <b title='do it - have sex ↗oral, anus, asshole, conceive, know up'>doing it</b>. What, what happened? Sorry- How did she die?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, ok we were in the market, and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Pheebs, I'm so sorry.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It was really <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>. The last thing she said to me was: "Ok dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." you know what?

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, ok. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a <b title='handbag'>purse</b>, and shows it to Joey.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really? A purse?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It looks like a woman's purse.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, Joey, look. Trust me, I tell you, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>See, look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is <b title='↗strange, weird'>odd</b> how a woman's purse looks good on me, a man.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Umm, no. See, I already thought she was dead so I've kinda made my <b title='a state when you are calm'>peace</b> with it. And <b title='used to add more information'>plus</b> I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.<br>

<i>Ursula</i>Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.

(As he walks past both Chandler and Ross notice the bag and stare at each other in shock.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! You look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. <b title='look at it'>Check it out</b>!

<i>Joey</i>Why would I <b title='at any time'>ever</b> return this? I love this bag!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, thanks!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, pulling flowers out of it makes the bag look a lot more <b title='having qualities considered to be typical of men or of what men do ≠feminine, girlie'>masculine</b>.<br>

<i>Man</i>Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?<br>

<i>Frank Sr.</i>Thank you. All right.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm, <b title='=all right'>all righty</b>, um, before we get started I just- I need you to state for the you know official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>So, what did Francis leave me?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Well, that's why you wanted-wanted me to come, right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh yes. Yes. Yeah- no, she did. She left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's (opens it) oh it's- ew used. Umm, cool.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm gonna get out my official forms. (She picks up a couple of <b title='crumple - crush sth so that it becomes smaller and bent ↗crumble, crumb'>crumpled</b> <b title='receipt - a piece of paper that you are given which shows that you have paid for sth'>receipts</b>.) Ok, so, question 1, you and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Yes, yes I was.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, umm, question 2, umm, did that marriage end A. Happily; B. Medium; or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>It really <b title='say - give information in writing'>says</b> that?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. See? (<b title='↗flash'>Quickly shows</b> him.)<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Well then I guess then I-I would have to say C.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm, ok, total abandonment. Uh-huh. Ok, reasons for abandonment, um, A. Top secret government work; B. <b title='the medical condition of not being able to remember anything [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia">Wiki</a>] ↗concussion'>Amnesia</b>, or C. you're just a, selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>You know what, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to leave.) But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?!<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I <b title='picture - imagine'>pictured</b> her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I felt, right,<b title='chicken out - decide at the last moment not to do sth because you are afraid'>chickened out</b>. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But you-you-you came to see Lilly?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Yeah, yeah. Why?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>She what?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She's dead.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Are you sure?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if she isn't <b title='cremate - burn the body of a dead person ↗incinerate'>cremating</b> her was a big mistake.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>I can't believe this. I just- I can't believe this. How-how- oh my God. How, how long ago?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>17 years ago.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Oh! What, what about the girls?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in <b title='a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoHo,_New_York">Wiki</a>] <img src="187px-105_Mercer_Street-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/105_Mercer_Street.jpg/187px-105_Mercer_Street.jpg">'>SoHo</b>.

(Silence <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='Yes'>Yep</b>, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you, huh.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Phoebe, I-I-I, umm, (Sits down next to her and <b title='brush - touch lightly'>brushes</b> against her leg.) <b title='said when sb falls or makes a small mistake'>Oops</b>. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes. Well, that's <b title='not relevant to the discussion/completely meaningless'>neither here nor there</b>.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>So would it, would it make you feel better if I said that I was very, very sorry I left?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>All right. Well, you know, <b title="in sb/sth's defense - sth that you say or do in order to support sb/sth that is being criticized">in my defense</b> I was a <b title='awful, terrible, crappy'>lousy</b> father.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's a defense?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Yes. I-, it is. I burned the <b title="a type of liquid food for babies that is similar to a woman's breast milk">formula</b> and I put your <b title="diaper - a piece of soft cloth or soft paper that is put between a baby's legs and fastened around its waist to hold liquid and solid waste">diapers</b> on backwards. I mean, I <b title='make up - produce a new story, song, game etc by thinking'>made up</b> a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You make up songs?<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. I-, <b title='also let me see - used when you are trying to remember sth ↗recall, recollection, memorize, learn by heart, ring a bell'>Let's see</b>, how did it, how did it <b title='be sounded, expressed'>go</b>. Umm. Yeah, ok (Singing.)<br>
<b title='tired and ready to sleep'>Sleepy</b> girl, sleepy girl.<br>
Why won't you go to sleep?<br>
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.<br>
You're, you're, you're keeping me <b title='up - not in bed'>uppp!</b> (Yeah, that's to the tune of Smelly Cat.)<br>
Yeah.<br>
(Phoebe is trying not to smile. He moves closer and very <b title='↗sheepish'>shyly</b> holds out his hand and turns his head, hoping for Phoebe to take his hand. She doesn't.)<br>
<i>Frank Sr.</i>I just, I you know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm... (Backs away.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)<br>
(She holds his hand for a little while then...)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Joey returns from his audition and finds everyone but Phoebe there.</s>

<i>All</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>, how did the audition <b title='happen/develop'>go</b>?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What kind of problem?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Nooooo!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know what? It was a stupid play anyway!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She's avoiding his eyes.) You think I should give up the bag!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry, I mean as <b title='very good'>terrific</b> as I think you are with it... (Looks for help.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I can't believe I'm hearing this!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just- it's just there are other bags. You know, that are maybe a little less umm, (Pause) <b title='causing a lot of disagreement ↗stirring'>controversial</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah umm, they're called wallets.<br>
(Monica laughs.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You're right. You're right. This-this bag has become like a part of me. You know? It's like... my bag. (Ross nods.) You know, I had a place for everything. It's- (starts looking in it <b title='frantic - almost out of control because of extreme emotion'>frantically</b>) Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>!<br>

<i>Joey</i>(reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me! I'm blank!<br>
<i>Monica</i>How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down! (She has her hand on his shoulder.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah you are baby.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doing?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So did they call you to tell you your name's <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be in this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. They really like me over there. They <b title='want to'>wanna</b> do a big <b title='a short description that gives important details about sb'>profile</b> on me, but I said no.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why'd you say no?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own <b title='line - words that a actor say in a play etc'>lines</b>, <b title='as a result'>and then</b> the writers got mad and made my character fall down the <b title='↗lift, escalator'>elevator</b> <b title='long narrow passage ↗chute'>shaft</b>? So, who knows what I might say this time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to express a strong wish'>If only</b> there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, come on Joey! You will totally <b title='keep sth in check - control sth that might cause damage or harm'>keep it in check</b> this time, and <b title='used to add more information ↗besides'>plus</b> you know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you could mention, oh, I don't know, <b title='girl/woman'>gal</b> <b title='friend'>pal</b> Rachel Green?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, don't listen to him. Please?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I, you know, start to say something stupid.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Just then or-or <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>, <b title='because'>'cause</b>, we have jobs you know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='encourage sb to do sth'>Come on</b>! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember, gal pal, Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!

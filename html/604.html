<i>Rachel</i>Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I don't- she, you know, said that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aw. Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna <b title='die ↗pass away'>go</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, <b title='because'>'cause</b> she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the <b title='used for emphasis'>very</b> end of the <b title='a period of time used for a particular activity (their meeting)'>session</b>, and I was not going to waste a whole another hour there!

<i>Ross</i>Please don't say naked chicks.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why not?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I-I-I don't even know why I bothered even talked to you guys about it. You know? I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok, come on, do it one more time!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? Really?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(entering) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going to die.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really?! How do you know?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
<s>Silvercup Studios, Joey has won the <b title='character / role'>part</b> of dying man and is now able to play the role he was injured for. Chandler is helping to carry him in.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(barely audible through the pain) Thank you.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>But are you sure you can do this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. All right? And thanks again for helping me take a shower.<br>
(Chandler steps away quickly.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Now, is that never talking about it again?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to the director) <b title='Hi ya (you) - used for saying "hello" to sb you know well'>Hiya</b>!<br>
<i>The Director</i>Hey Joey, we're ready for you! (Joey <b title='stumble - step awkwardly'>stumbles</b> over) Eh, Joey, this is Alex, he's gonna be playing your son.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)<br>
<i>The Director</i>Ok. (to Alex) All right uh, Alex, <b title="used for getting sb's attention">now</b> when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your <b title='a word or action in a play etc, which is used as a signal'>cue</b> to cry. <b title='get - understand'>Got</b> it? (Alex nods yes.) All right, let's do this.<br>
(Joey lies down on the <b title='a light bed on wheels, used to move patients in a hospital'>gurney</b>.)<br>
<i>A Crew Member</i>(with that board <b title='used for referring to sth when you do not know or cannot remember the name of it.

<i>The Director</i>And Action!<br>
<i>Joey</i>"Take good care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him and the director <b title='motion - make a signal to sb ↗gesture'>motions</b> for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take good care of your Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on, son! Your Momma's good people!"<br>
<i>The Director</i>Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?<br>
<i>Alex</i>Ok.<br>
<i>The Director</i>All right, from the top.<br>
<i>A Crew Member</i>Scene 5, take 2.<br>
[Time lapse.]<br>
<i>A Crew Member</i>Take 36 is <b title='ready'>up</b>!<br>
<i>The Director</i>All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah, one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream <b title='very close to ↗just now, by now, right now'>right up until</b> you say action?<br>
<i>The Director</i>Uh, sure.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. (Starts screaming.)<br>
<i>The Director</i>Action!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma." (Again Alex does nothing.)<br>
<i>The Director</i>Cut! (Joey starts screaming again.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Sorry, hey, hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this <b title='used by adults to address a young person'>kiddo</b>. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!

<i>Rachel</i>(answering it) Hello?<br>
<i>Russell</i>(Ross's divorce lawyer.) Hello, is Ross there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?<br>
<i>Russell</i>Yes, this is Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross got married again? Nooooooo!
<s>a NYU lecture hall, Ross is trying to phase out his accent.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So, without re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dating">Wiki</a>]'>carbon dating</b> analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)<br>
<i>A Student</i>What's happening to your accent?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(British) <b title='used to ask sb to repeat what they have just said'>Come again</b>? What's-what's this <b title='ideas, opinions, statements etc that are not true or that seem very stupid'>nonsense</b>? (<b title='giggle - laugh repeatedly in a quiet but uncontrolled and childish way, such as when you are nervous'>Giggles</b>.) (American.) All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island">Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-Long_Island_Landsat_Mosaic-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Long_Island_Landsat_Mosaic.jpg/250px-Long_Island_Landsat_Mosaic.jpg">'>Long Island</b>. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look, I was just trying to make a good first impression. <b title='↗apparently, decidedly, evidently'>Obviously</b>, I <b title='screw up - make a bad mistake/do sth very stupid'>screwed up</b>. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a <b title='≠ temporary'>permanent</b> job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...<br>
(At this moment Rachel bursts through the door. Needless to say, she's not in the best of moods having just found out Ross's dirty little secret.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife! What, were you just never gonna tell me?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Ugh, I could just kill you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(in the accent again) Well-hello Rachel!
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Joey is holding a football helmet; and <b title='according to the way sb looks or a situation appears'>apparently</b>, in a rather disgusting scene, Joey wants Phoebe to beat him <b title='happening or done for no good reason or with no purpose/unconscious'>senseless</b>. (Luckily it isn't <b title='"a long scene" in this case'>a long trip</b>.) Because he's made a <b title='extremely lucky and unexpected ↗miracle'>miraculous</b> recovery from his hernia and wants to take advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since he's re-established his health insurance.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>So you've really done this before?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big <b title='an attempt to hit sb/sth by making a smooth curving movement'>swing</b>. Ok? Now, don't <b title='to not do sth, often because of fear'>hold back</b>. (He <b title='don - put on'>dons</b> his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey-hey-hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, all right.<br>
(Decided that they are less than human as well, Chandler picks up a golf club and Monica a frying pan, to join in on the fun of beating their good friend to <b title="within an inch of one's life - almost to death">within an inch of his life</b>!)<br>
(The camera <b title='shoot - use a camera to record a film or take a photograph'>shoots</b> to an outside view of the apartment as we hear Joey getting hit.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>See, now let's try one without the helmet.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Good, you guys are all here!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! <b title="'Is there anything new?' / 'What happened?'">What's up</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I have a job interview at <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren">Wiki</a>'>Ralph Lauren</b> tomorrow!<br>
<i>All</i>Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I know!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used as an interjection'>Boy</b>, that guy's underwear <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-what?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I got this pair marked <b title='Extra Small'>XS</b>, let me tell you, there was no room for <b title='extra'>excess</b> anything in there.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Anyway, I'm <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be the <b title='sb who organizes the way people work together in a particular activity ↗liaison'>coordinator</b> of the woman's <b title='a range of new clothes produced by one clothes designer'>collection</b>, I'll work right under the director, I mean it's the perfect, perfect job for me!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow! Well, if you <b title='do sth in a perfect way'>nail</b> the interview, you'll get it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You <b title='want to'>wanna</b> work on your interview skills?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
(They shake hands.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Very good handshake, good wrist action.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. (They shake hands and she <b title='↗recoil, flinch, grimace, wince'>pulls away</b> suddenly) Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Did I squeeze it too hard?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.<br>
(Chandler tries to <b title='understand'>comprehend</b> that <b title='comment'>remark</b>.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the window waving at Ross.</s>
<i>Joey</i>That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! You can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as <b title='two days ago'>the day before</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Is he doing his shark attack <b title='a short scene'>bit</b> yet?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. Op, wait! <b title='used when sb does sth annoying that they often do'>There he goes</b>.<br>
(We see Ross through the window and he acts like a swimmer that gets attacked by a shark, <b title='imagine'>picture</b> one of the many, many, many <b title='a 1975 American horror / thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley&#039;s novel of the same name. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)">Wiki</a>]'>Jaws</b> movies they made and you get the idea.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(waving) Very funny Ross! Very <b title='describeing sth that appears real or very similar to reality'>lifelike</b> and funny. Ok. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I-I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally <b title='sexy'>hot</b> girl in Ross's building is <b title='flirt - behave toward sb in a way that shows your sexual or romantic interest in them'>flirting</b> with me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Get in there <b title='used as an interjection'>man</b>! Flirt back, <b title='do sth fun / entertaining / exciting; add difference to anything you are doing'>mix it up</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I-I-I'm <b title='be down with - accept or agree to'>down with</b> that. (He turns back to the woman.) Ok, <b title='used when you are going to try to do sth and you are not sure whether you will be successful'>here goes</b>. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) ah-doing? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then <b title='wink - quickly close and open one eye as a sign'>winks</b>. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Ok, I-I-I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...<br>
<i>Monica</i>(joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used to say you already know about sth'>Tell me about it</b>, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, I'm not with her, no, that-that's just Monica! (He <b title='represent or express in pantomime (conveying emotions, actions, feelings, etc., by gestures without speech)'>pantomimes</b> that out.) <b title='↗eww, yuck'>Ewwuck</b>! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
<s>Ross's Building, Joey is trying to find the hot girl's apartment. So he's walking up the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b> counting doors. He comes to what he thinks is the right one and knocks on it. Ross opens the door, it's his apartment.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Joey! <b title='My shark attack bit is great stuff'>Great stuff</b> huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>This's your place?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go <b title='beside'>by</b> the window, you can pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering again.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Ugh!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I <b title='end up - finally be in a particular place or situation'>ended up</b> at Ross's place. Oh, I must've miss-counted or something. (Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and <b title='flip through - quickly look through/at'>flipping through</b> the channels on his <b title='remote control'>remote</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No Joey, I think he's just watching TV.<br>
(It's only when the camera cuts to Ross's apartment that we see that the TV is turned off and Ross is indeed doing a bit. He then tries to hide his <b title='silly or self-satisfied smile ↗grin'>smirk</b>.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, later that day, Gary is kissing Phoebe goodbye.</s>
<i>Gary's Radio</i>We've lost visual contact with the suspect.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Ok, now I've really have to go!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But it's just so unfair that our <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> has to get cut short just <b title='because'>'cause</b> some guy shot at a <b title='sb whose job is to help people in a shop'>store clerk</b>.<br>
<i>Gary</i>I know, but it's my job, sweetheart!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, then maybe I can come too!<br>
<i>Gary's Radio</i>Suspect has just emerged naked from the <b title='an underground pipe or passage that carries sewage (the mixture of waste from the human body and used water)'>sewer</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, you go. (They kiss.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Bye-bye.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, bye!<br>
(Gary closes the door behind him.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh God!<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh I just miss him so much!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow! For just a week you guys are really <b title='↗tight, intimidate, intimate'>close</b>, huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>, he's like this, this little puppy dog, you know? But like a really <b title='strict/firm'>tough</b> one who, shoots bad guys. Ohh, I just love the beginning parts of relationships, you know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other and-<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know, it is the best.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, God. So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What? It's still going on.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Come on, seriously! When did it end?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're <b title='be all over sb - be trying to kiss sb and touch them, esp in a sexual way ↗drool'>all over</b> each other <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, well, you know where you are, better than I do. I was just curious.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Start annoying <b title='more than usual or normal ↗super, ultra'>hyper-</b>competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) Why don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you know you're the only <b title='hot - sexually exciting'>hot</b> couple!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='in a quiet voice so that no one can hear her'>Under her breath</b>) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong, <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b>, I just - I <b title='↗misspell - spell a word wrongly'>misspoke</b>. It's ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh-hey, it is ok, I mean <b title='on condition that, provided that'>as long as</b> you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and <b title='showing very strong feeling'>fiery</b>, I mean just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, it is <b title='good, performing well'>on fire</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Hey Monica, here's your <b title='a large brush with a long handle, used for sweeping floors'>broom</b> back.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You are so <b title='sexually attractive'>cute</b>. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow, the cute <b title='a horizontal rod that marks the height to be cleared in high jumping or pole vaulting. [<a href="Pole vault">Wiki</a>] <img src="300px-Pole_Vault_Sequence_3-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Pole_Vault_Sequence_3.jpg/300px-Pole_Vault_Sequence_3.jpg">'>bar</b> keeps getting lower and lower, doesn't it? (They kiss again.)
<s>Monica and Rachel's, the next day, Chandler and Joey are there as Rachel returns from her interview.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh hey, how'd the interview go?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> fall right out of your chair?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Did you get drunk on the way over there?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well that explains why you didn't do the other <b title='things'>stuff</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So what happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, you know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If-if you've got enough life jackets!" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so, we were saying goodbye and ugh!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(We see a <b title='a short part of a film, story or play that goes back to events in the past'>flashback</b> as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we were shaking hands and he kind of leaned toward me... You know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally <b title='make a wrong judgment about sb or situation =misinterpret ↗misunderstand'>missread</b> him and I uhhh... (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You kissed him?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I-I didn't know what else to do!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thanks Chandler.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, that's not funny.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, ok. Umm, (does a little cheer dance and <b title='words sung or shouted rhythmically ↗rap'>chant</b> to <b title='go together'>go with</b> it) A guy from Ralph Lauren called. You got a second interview.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God, Monica, you better be serious.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You just told me to be funny!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! I can't, I can't believe it! I got a second interview!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah <b title='used to say you are sure that sht is true'>I bet</b> that kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What-what, wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?<br>
<i>Monica</i>A kiss? What're you talking about?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Aw. I-I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back you know of course, because "Let's bring back the girl who kisses everybody!"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Come on, Rach.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens, esp sth unpleasant'>What if</b> he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?<br>
<i>Monica</i>He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Maybe. I-I don't know- Oh, God, how could I be so stupid?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that, I-I think you just need a <b title='↗snuggle, embrace, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b> from Joey. Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's back!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ohh, well I'm not totally <b title='like "be back on your feet - be successful again after having problems"'>back</b> yet, but thank you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Ok, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) One, two, three, done! (Runs out and does a little hop over a chair.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I <b title='have go to'>gotta</b> <b title='look at'>check out</b> this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
<s>Ross's building, Joey is knocking on a door again. It's again answered by Ross.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Damn it! Did you move?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey just stares at him) I'm Ross.<br>
(Joey makes a <b title='feeling annoyed, upset, and impatient, because you cannot control or change a situation, or achieve sth ↗doom, destiny, fate'>frustrated</b> face and noise and walks away. He knocks on the next door and it's answered by an old man.)<br>
<i>The Old Man</i>Yes?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Looking around) Uhh do you <b title='↗by any chance'>happen to</b> have a hot girl in there?<br>
<i>The Old Man</i>No. I'm all alone.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter <b title='used to ask politely whether sth is true'>by any chance</b> a hot girl?<br>
<i>The Little Girl</i>Daddy!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh <b title='see you later'>later</b>! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!
<s>Rachel's job interview, she is waiting outside Mr. Zelner's (the interviewer) office banging her pen between her teeth.</s>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Hi Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Come on in.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
(They go inside.)<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>It's really nice to see you again.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>(Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel, uhh... (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Just ah... (He points again.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Here let me... (He goes to wipe it off himself.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, ok, I see, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look, look, I am sorry if I have given you the wrong impression, but I am not some <b title='a woman who is sexually immoral'>hussy</b> who will just sleep around to <b title='be successful and do better than other people in a job or work'>get ahead</b>! Now even- (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that <b title='=badly - to a great or serious degree'>bad</b>. <b title='used as a greeting or when saying goodbye during the day'>Good day</b>, sir. (She storms out of his office.) (to a girl who is sitting outside his office) You're going in there to see Mr. Zelner, I hope you're ready to <b title='have sex willingly'>put out</b>. (leaves)<br>
<i>Woman Waiting</i>I am.

<s>Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from her interview attempt.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Ugh, you're not gonna believe what that <b title='a bad person/pervert. sleaze - immoral behavior, esp involving sex or lies'>sleazeball</b> from Ralph Lauren did to me!<br>
(Joey, Monica, and Ross all point to their lips to get Rachel to once again notice the ink on her lip.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, ok that-that's amazing. How did you know that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You got ink on your lip.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh....<br>
<s>Central Perk, Phoebe and Gary and Chandler and Monica are all there.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Gary) So <b title='used to ask sbif they agree with a suggestion'>what do you say</b>, maybe uh sometime I-I hold your gun?<br>
<i>Gary</i>I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Op, what could happen? I mean, would you... (He <b title='gesture - make a movement with your hands or head in order to show or tell sb sth ↗singal, motion'>gestures</b> and spills some of his coffee.)<br>
<i>Gary</i>Yeah, I'm gonna say no.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So Phoebe, do you wanna go see a movie after dinner tonight?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, we can't, we already have plans.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you doing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Um, well, same thing we did all day, just <b title='spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hang out</b> at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(That annoying competitiveness thing <b title='kick in - start'>kicks in</b> again, what the <b title='↗hell, shoot, shit, freaking, fucking, flipping, flinging-flanging'>heck</b> is <b title="what's with sb? - used to ask why sb is behaving strangely">with her</b> and why must the writers show it every <b title='used to show that you are slightly annoyed about sth'>flipping</b> episode?!) Oh, we're not seeing a movie!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, umm, that's because I just, you know, wanted to know if you guys were <b title='doing it (having sex)'>doing</b>, so, you know, you wouldn't <b title='go into a room and accidentally interrupt sb who is doing sth private that they would not want you to see'>walk in on</b> me and Chandler, while we were, you know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh, yeah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat them! {<b title='here we go again - used when sth unpleasant is beginning to happen again. yet again - one more time after many others'>Here we go yet again</b>.}<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why?<br>
<i>Monica</i>'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ohh, so?<br>
<i>Monica</i>So! So we've <b title='got to'>gotta</b> go upstairs and have a lot of sex and prove them wrong!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Ok? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of <b title='good judgment'>reason</b>.} I mean, just to impress Gary and Phoebe, you want we to go upstairs, and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
<s>The lobby in Ross's building, we see a <b title='a small sheet of paper with information on it ↗poster'>flyer</b> that is on the bulletin board that reads, "Are you the Hot Girl who waved at me? If so, give me a call!" and it's signed, Joey 629-9*** (The last couple of numbers have been ripped off). <b title='=anyway - despite sth that you have previously mentioned'>Anyhow</b>, Ross is getting his mail.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!<br>
<i>The Woman</i>Hi.<br>
(A man walks up.)<br>
<i>The Man</i>(To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of Joey and it reads, "Warning! <b title='sb who enters a place without permission in order to commit a crime'>Intruder</b>!

(For the first time we see that the woman Ross is talking too is in fact the hot girl that Joey is looking for. She just <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> stares at him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't think we've meet. I'm-I'm Ross.<br>

<i>The Hot Girl</i>No, I-I actually thought it was really unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen, umm...<br>
<i>The Hot Girl</i>Jen.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Jen, I know this may sound a little...(makes some kind of crazy noise) But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...<br>
<i>Jen</i>Sure! That would be nice.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Umm?<br>
<i>Jen</i>Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I will give you a call.<br>
<i>Jen</i>I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok!<br>

<i>Monica</i>What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!<br>

<i>Monica</i>No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the <b title='the room into which the main entrance door opens in a hotel or other large building'>lobby</b>. And you know the other one over there, that's the <b title='a set of stairs inside or outside a building'>stairway</b>. You've been counting wrong.<br>

<i>Mr. Zelner</i><b title='used to say that you understand why sb has done or said sth'>Fair enough</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who uh, (She puts her hands on his desk <b title='a large sheet of blotting paper (soft thick paper used for drying wet ink on a page after writing) kept in a special holder on a desk'>blotter</b> and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big, big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows <b title='the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles'>integrity</b>. And, I was not afraid to <b title='defend/support'>stand up for</b> myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Ok, <b title='used when pausing when you are thinking what to say next'>now</b> I-I know I already said courage, but, you know you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> have courage. And umm, and finally, when I thought you were making sexual <b title='advance - an attempt to start a sexual relationship with sb'>advances</b> in the workplace, I said no and I was not <b title='always ready to deal with disagreements by suing (starting a legal case) rather than by discussion'>litigious</b>. So <b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb'>there you go</b>, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr. ...<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Zelner.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Zelner! Right! I knew that! Oh, I knew that. Uh, I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>You know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm gonna give you a <b title='chance'>shot</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(<b title='gasp - take a short quick breath through the mouth'>gasps</b>) Oh! You are?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Um-hmm.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate if I give you a hug?<br>
<i>Mr. Zelner</i>Yes!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, well, then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his <b title='the area where your legs join the front of your body ↗crotch'>groin</b>.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not <b title='↗intend to, on purpose'>mean to</b> touch that- I mean you, there, uh, there. Uhh, ok, so, thank, thank you, I'm gonna to leave, thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so- Hey! I'll-I'll see you Monday! Ok! (Exits.)

<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the <b title='a material or substance that covers the inside surface of sth'>lining</b>.)

<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, you have a, a <b title='a small thin branch of a tree or bush'>twig</b> in your hair.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little <b title='a different or indirect route to a place'>detour</b> on the way over here.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Yeah, we're taking a little <b title='a slow walk for pleasure'>stroll</b> through the park and no one was around, so...<br>
<i>Monica</i>You didn't!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We did! We <b title='↗breach, breech, defy'>violated</b> Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the <b title='A criminal code (or penal code) is a document which compiles all, or a significant amount of, a particular jurisdiction&#039;s criminal law.

<i>Monica</i>The park huh? Public place.<br>
<i>Gary</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I hear <b title='you'>ya</b>. Excuse me for a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)<br>
[Cut to the Men's room. Chandler is practicing flashing his badge as Monica enters.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi Chandler.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes it is. I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No. And if I did, I-I don't think we'd be going out. Ok, you know what, I don't wanna disappoint you and I really don't wanna disappoint the guy in the second <b title='a small enclosed private area for washing or using the toilet'>stall</b> (a man walks out of the stall) Sorry, man. (The man leaves.) But come on, this is getting ridiculous!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on, we can't let them win!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ugh, we have already proved we are hot! Ok? So why-why are you getting so <b title='unable to stop thinking about sth'>obsessed</b> about this thing?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(gasps) So?<br>
<i>Monica</i>So?! I feel really sad that we're not... really there anymore.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Aw, wow! Is that what this all 's been about?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were you know all over each other all the time?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah, that was great. That was really, great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are now.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that 's lasted this long <b title='at an earlier time'>before</b>. You know? And get past the beginning and still wanna be around each other all the time? Well I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is all happening with you, yeah I think that's <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> exciting. (Kisses her.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah. (They hug.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what I just realized? You just <b title='become very anxious, upset or afraid'>freaked out</b> about our relationship.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I did not.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I freaked out a little.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>A little?! You freaked out <b title='to a very large degree ↗way'>big time</b>! Ok? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship king and you are the crazy, <b title='not using reason or clear thinking'>irrational</b> <b title='sb who makes many mistakes'>screw-up</b>! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.

<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) I cannot believe Ross is <b title='buy - believe'>buying</b> this!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!<br>

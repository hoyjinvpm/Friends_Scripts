<i>Chandler</i>You know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done. And you said it was <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be fun.

<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, there's a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's a mailman! That's our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are <b title='you'>ya</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails <b title='↗feminine, masculine, sissy, girlie'>like women do</b>.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Ohh, Nothing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know what it did! Nothing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Like this. (Shrugs)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that little silver knob on the toilet does?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sure! Flushes it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, good. <b title='because of / as a result of'>Now that</b>- since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it's closed) I can't stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?! I thought you were crazy about her!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, I know, but you know all those little annoying things that she did before we fell in love? You know, like her voice, and her laugh, and her <b title='character'>personality</b>! Well, they're all back! You know? And she's <b title='pick up - get (an illness)'>picked up</b> like nine new ones!<br>
<i>Joey</i>So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!<br>

<i>Rachel</i>You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved!

(At that moment two very large men start <b title='↗shriek, squeal, squeak, screech'>screaming</b> and running towards Emily and <b title='pick up - lift sb/sth up'>picking her up</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Help! Help!! Help! Help!!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Huh! Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something- or-or should I call it (In an English accent) football?<br>

<i>Liam</i>In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.<br>
<i>Emily</i>(Laughs) Ross play rugby? I don't think so.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, what's so funny about that?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Well I mean, you're American <b title='said to emphasize the first of a list of facts or opinions you are stating'>to start with</b>. You don't even have rugby here.<br>

<i>Janice</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>, I just love to sing!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, I-I know that you do. I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was because most of the people would've paid to hear the actor, sing <b title='a song in the 1927 musical Show Boat [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol%27_Man_River">Wiki</a>]'>Old Man River</b>.<br>

<i>Janice</i>I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about "<b title='sth was certain to happen and that no one could have prevented it ↗fate, destiny'>meant to be</b>"!<br>

<i>Janice</i>Oh, too soon, too <b title='schm- prefix used to form a rhyming term of derision by replacing the initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word or by preceding the initial vowel'>schmoon</b>. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.

<i>Rachel</i>(Entering, with Joey) Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! <b title='What is happening / what is wrong'>What's up</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aw. This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So, I turned it off and checked every <b title='a place on a wall where electrical equipment can be connected to the electricity supply ↗socket, plug, jack'>outlet</b>. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, <b title='used when you go on to mention the likely consequence or effect of sth ↗this way, thus'>that way</b> when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Ok. All right! So, everybody ready? <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth'>Here we go</b>. (She flips on the switch and a <b title='a low continuous sound'>hum</b> starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realizes it's Joey.)<br>

<i>Janice</i>(Leaning in from the bedroom) Hey Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and <b title='↗push, shove, tuck'>stuff</b> it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Ok, Chandler, come on!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Janice) Ok. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. (To Ross) Man, look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how <b title='very cruel and violent ↗savage, vicious'>brutal</b> this is!<br>

<i>Ross</i>That's 'cause your mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Pointing to the TV) Ok, Ross, look-look-look-look-look, right here. That's called a <b title='a part of a game of rugby when the players all push together in a circle, with their heads down, and try to get the ball'>scrum</b>, ok?

<i>Joey</i>Ross! (Laughs) They're gonna kill you!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, why are you doing this, anyway?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like <b title="a popular name for boys">Joe</b> Rugby.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. (Realizes) Ohh! I see, you did that. All right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Anyway, she thought the <b title='used to emphasize a noun'>very</b> idea of me playing rugby with him was like <b title='extremely funny'>hilarious</b>. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest <b title='paleontology - the study of fossils'>paleontologist</b> I know.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(from his bedroom) Thanks!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, don't worry about me. Ok? I'll just look real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.

<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to tell sb that you hope that what you are going to say or do will not offend them'>No offence</b>, but you know, sometimes it's hard to understand you, you know with the accent, so...<br>
(The whistle blows.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>That's just halftime, there's more of this.<br>
(Ross <b title='limp - walk slowly and with difficulty because one leg is hurt or injured ↗lame, limb'>limps</b> over all covered in mud.)<br>
<i>Joey & Phoebe</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Did you see me? That was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!<br>
<i>Emily</i>Right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Emily) Hey, do me a favor, would you, <b title='used when suggesting or supposing sth'>say</b>, grab me a bottle of water?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks. (When she's gone he <b title='↗break down, fall'>collapses</b> into Joey.) I-I think I'm dying. I-I really do.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, poor baby.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Aw, excellent! Well, ok, I gotta have some more fun!<br>
<i>Emily</i>Ross, they are killing you out there!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='whine - complain in a sad, annoying voice about sth =moan ↗groan'>whines</b> "No.") That's not true!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She's right! You have to stop!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't care! I am not quitting! I am gonna finish this game!<br>
<i>Emily</i>All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.<br>
<i>Emily</i>No. That's not what I was saying. I just might know a few things that could help you <b title='make sb suffer sth unpleasant ↗suffer, agony, anguish'>inflict</b> some pain.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I like that.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Yeah? Listen <b title='very carefully ↗attentively, intently'>closely</b>, Devon has got a weak ankle.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Emily</i>One <b title='done quickly'>swift</b> kick and he'll <b title='move backwards'>back off</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, bad ankle, got it!<br>
<i>Emily</i>And-and that big <b title='man'>bloke</b> with the beard, he has got a <b title='a trick knee/ankle/shoulder etc - a joint that is weak and can suddenly cause you problems'>trick</b> hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a <b title='a protective covering used by men in sports to cover their genitals'>cup</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? I <b title='if you say you could use sth, you mean you would really like to have it'>could use</b> that, trick hip, no cup, ok! Ok!<br>
<i>Emily</i>And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.<br>
<i>Ross</i>But-but, Liam's on my team.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I don't care! You just <b title='attack/kill/hurt'>get</b> him!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm gonna go get him! Ok, I am going back in! (<b title='squeal - make a long loud high sound or cry'>Squeals</b> like a madman.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>The Red Ross! Yeah!
<s>Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is reading a book as Rachel returns.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren't there originally.) What-what are-what are these?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd <b title='make sth brighter. -en - make sth have a particular quality ↗darken'>brighten up</b> the place. They do, don't you think?<br>
(Rachel rips one off the wall and finds a huge hole underneath.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no-no, no!<br>
(Rachel rips off another one, revealing another hole. Rachel then moves on to a third one.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.<br>
(Rachel looks at it and then throws the pictures away. She then removes a fourth one, revealing a third hole.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! Look at this!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't care! <b title='↗robot, android'>The wires have come loose in your head</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And did you?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. It disappears back there behind that <b title='a narrow board fixed to the bottom of indoor walls where they meet the floor'>baseboard</b>.<br>
(Rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly in a way that can be heard'>gasps</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God.<br>
<i>Mrs. Chatracus</i>Hello darling.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, Mrs. Chatracus, do you know Kenny? (Points to the ceiling)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You 've got to be kid- (Looks up) Wow! (Jumps up and screams in horror) What?!
<s>Central Perk, They are returning from the rugby game, Joey and Emily are carrying Ross.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>Now</b>, are you sure you don't wanna go see a doctor?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh no! That-that'll just <b title='bring down - reduce sth to a lower level ↗underestimate, underrate, degenerate'>bring me down</b>! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This was a great day! You know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, sure.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, not you. (Emily gets it.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok. Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little there, I'm gonna go get some ice.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>You were amazing out there.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?<br>
<i>Emily</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche">Wiki</a>] <img src="100px-Porsche_logotype-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/Porsche_logotype.png/100px-Porsche_logotype.png"> ↗<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari"><img src="100px-Ferrari-Logo.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Ferrari-Logo.svg/100px-Ferrari-Logo.svg.png"></a>'>Porsche</b> with rocks.<br>
<i>Emily</i>You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose. I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, yeah, wonderful, amazing you.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I think you've got <b title='temporary damage to the brain caused by a fall or hit on the head or by violent shaking [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion">Wiki</a>] ↗coma, pass out'>concussion</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.<br>
<i>Emily</i>You're welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he <b title='↗grimace'>winces</b>.) I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) You know what, you know what? It's not.
<s>The airport, the flight to Yemen is being called.</s>
<i>Ticket Counter Attendant</i>(on the <b title='public address system (equipment for making sound louder in a public place)'>P.A.</b>) This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I-I guess I gotta go.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're gonna be gone?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, just until we find an energy source to <b title='↗substitute, instead of, rather then'>replace</b> <b title='gas, petrol, gasoline, diesel, paraffin, crude oil'>fuel</b>.<br>
<i>Janice</i>Oh. Well, I'll write you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 <b title='Sanaa is the capital of Yemen [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana%27a">Wiki</a>] <img src="300px-San%27a03_flickr-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/San%27a03_flickr.jpg/300px-San%27a03_flickr.jpg">'>Yemen Road</b>, Yemen.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, goodbye. Goodbye.<br>
(He gives the agent his ticket and walks onto the <b title='a raised enclosed passage through which passengers walk from an airport building to an aircraft'>jetway</b>. Janice walks over and looks out the window. Chandler walks back into the terminal and tries to walk right past Janice, but she sees him.)<br>
<i>Janice</i>Chandler?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No!<br>
<i>Janice</i>Chandler!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were gonna leave right after I got on the plane!<br>
<i>Janice</i>No! No! I-I wanna <b title='↗see off, I hope you had a good journey. Have a safe journey. Did you have a good journey?'>see</b> you take off.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well I guess then I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! (To <b title='to introduce sb/sth into a story'>this</b> old woman also going to Yemen.) When we <b title='arrive at/in'>get to</b> Yemen, can I stay with you?
<s>Chandler and Joey's ,erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica has finally given up on her search to find what the light switch does and is now flicking it on and off aimlessly.</s>
<i>Monica</i>All right. The <b title='superintendent (sb who is in charge of an apartment building and is responsible for making repairs in it) ↗janitor'>super</b> couldn't <b title='think about a problem or situation until you find the answer or understand what has happened'>figure out</b> what it did.

I've had seven <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> serious <b title='shock - an electric shock'>shocks</b>. I officially give up.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank God.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Guess Joey was right, it does nothing.<br>
[Cut to Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. The TV is turning off and on, and each time Phoebe is blinking her eyes like <b title="a magical creature in old Arabian stories that will do what you want when you call it ↗Aladdin">the Genie</b> did. The switch obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.<br>

<i>Monica</i>(she enters) Hey guys!<br>
<i>Ross, Rachel and Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That place in <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Vermont_in_United_States.svg/270px-Vermont_in_United_States.svg.png"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont">Wiki</a>]'>Vermont</b>? You can take a hint!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We're having a party.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to show that you are surprised or annoyed ↗jee, geez, jeez, Jesus'>Gee</b> <b title='used to say you would like a situation to be different'>if only</b> she were one and had no idea what <b title='used to add emphasis'>the hell</b> a birthday was!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used to encourage sb to do sth'>Come on</b>, you guys, this is really important to us.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I <b title='could use - used to say sb/sth needs sth very much'>could really use</b> a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in <b title='an international men&#039;s magazine [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_%28magazine%29">Wiki</a>]'>Maxim</b>...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I <b title='used to say you are sorry to do sth'>hate to</b> delay you doing weird sex <b title='things'>stuff</b> to my <b title="sb's little brother/sister - sb's younger brother/sister">little sister</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a <b title='an important or exciting event or situation'>big deal</b>. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I promise I-I won't do any <b title='the skill of performing tricks to entertain people, such as making things appear and disappear and pretending to cut sb in half ↗magician, sorcerer, wizard, conjurer, illuionist'>magic</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, we'll stay. We just drive up after the party.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
<s>Rachel and Joey's apartment.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(he enters) Hey, guys!<br>
<i>Rachel and Phoebe</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, COOL! Wow, it's like a <b title=' a historic cache of goods or information [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule">Wiki</a>]'>time capsule</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, just think... she's <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented <b title='used in negative statements and questions to talk about whether sth that was expected has happened'>yet</b>! With friends who <b title='at the present time'>right now</b> are just like babies! And they'll be living in a, a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's the hope! So, is uh Emma awake yet?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be <b title='not in bed'>up</b> soon.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ah, and where is Joey?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I said it's still nap time.<br>
(Joey comes out from his room, <b title='yawn - open your mouth wide and take a big breath, usually because you are tired or bored ↗yarn'>yawning</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='tape - record sounds or pictures using tape'>taping</b> Joey with the <b title='camera'>cam</b>) Hey, there is uncle Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!<br>
<i>Joey</i>18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doing" <b title='words'>line</b>)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey, NO!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What, what!? it's for her <b title='sexy ↗cute, gorgeous'>hot</b> friends!<br>
<i>Ross</i>When they see this you'll, be 52!<br>
<i>Joey</i>And starting to think about <b title='settle down - begin to live a quieter life by getting married or staying permanently in a place'>settling down</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey Joey, will you please <b title='set up - build a structure or put it in a particular place'>set this up</b> for people to put Emma's presents on?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'd love to! Yeah! <br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey, it's a birthday party.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the <b title='idea, meaning, purpose'>point</b>... <b title='a few days ago'>the other day</b> she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just, just a cup with a picture of <b title='a Muppet character on the children&#039;s television show Sesame Street. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmo">Wiki</a>]'>Elmo</b> on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-<b title='↗baa, meow, woof, oink'>moo</b>"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!<br>
(Monica and Chandler enter)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, she's still napping.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, I know that you guys really <b title='want to'>wanna</b> <b title='arrive somewhere'>get to</b> Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Are you <b title='used instead of fucking ↗heck, hell, shoot, shit, flinging-flanging'>freaking</b> kidding me, <b title='Rachel Green'>Green</b>?<br>
(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)<br>
<i>Jack and Judy</i>HI!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(points the <b title='a type of camera that records pictures and sound on videotape'>camcorder</b> towards them to record their entrance) Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>So glad you came!<br>
<i>Jack</i>I can't believe Emma is already one!<br>
<i>Judy</i>(to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his <b title='testicle - one of two round male sex organs that hang in a bag of skin behind the penis ↗balls, nuts'>testicles</b> so hard! We had to take him to the <b title='ER'>emergency room</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Oh, let me help you with that.<br>
<i>Jack</i>Thank you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!<br>
<i>Jack</i>Which one are you?<br>
(Later...)<br>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe Emma is still asleep!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know, what are we gonna do?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to <b title='hit or push sth with force'>ram</b> this <b title='a large plate used for serving food'>platter</b> really hard into your <b title='rib - one of the 12 pairs of curved bones that surround your chest'>ribs</b>. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! Pheebs, <b title="Listen to what I'm going to tell you">you know what</b>? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my <b title='talent - a natural ability to do something well ↗gift'>talents</b>! <br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So you're gonna... <b title='talk to sb in a way that shows you are sexually attracted to them ↗come on to, flirt'>hit on</b> her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, no! My talents as an actor!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or you could stick a fork in an apple!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, I think Emma might like it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Emma might like what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Um, my present!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What did you get her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Actually we prepared performances.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, separate performances.<br>
<i>Joey</i>But equally real!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, that sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little <b title='nervous and unable to relax ↗-y - like or typical of sth'>antsy</b> waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure, yeah!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(unconfidently) O...K.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok! All right, everybody, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, great!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole <b title='a group of people with a particular skill who work together ↗staff'>crew</b> waiting!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So, Joey, what're you gonna do for us?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. Ok, which one?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh, why, it's a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) "<b title='ride out the storm - continue to exist and not be harmed during a very difficult period'>Riding the Storm Out</b>. <b title='cope - deal successfully with a difficult situation or job'>Coping</b> with <b title='after giving birth'>postpartum</b> <b title='a feeling of being extremely unhappy'>depression</b>" eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) "Love you forever". Love you forever. By <b title='an American-born Canadian children&#039;s author [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Munsch">Wiki</a>]'>Robert Munsch</b>. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly <b title='rock - move gently'>rocked</b> him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him, she sang: "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, <b title='during the time /on the condition that'>as long as</b> I'm living, my baby, you'll be". (the picture <b title='fade - gradually disappear'>fades</b> and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you, for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(crying) Wow! That was amazing!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you so much for that gift!<br>
<i>Chandler (nearly weeping)</i>I was not ready for this today!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Amazing... amazing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name <b title='pose - create a difficult or dangerous situation'>poses</b> a <b title='a situation in which you have to make a difficult decision ↗paradox, diploma, diplomacy'>dilemma</b>. <b title='Because'>'Cause</b> not much else <b title='if two words or lines of poetry rhyme, they end with the same sound, including a vowel ↗rhythm'>rhymes</b> with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Blood">Wiki</a>]'>Rambo</b>. Happy birthday Emma!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Is that it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, of course not! No, I've, I've, also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). Um, "Sex and the single mother.

<i>Judy</i>Hello, Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.<br>
<i>Jack</i>Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.<br>
<i>Judy</i>Yes, you'll be all grown up <b title='(at) that time (in the past or in the future)'>by then</b>. We'll be... Well, your grandfather and I might not be here.<br>
<i>Jack</i>That's true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the <b title='the place where a dead body is buried in a deep hole in the ground ↗tomb'>grave</b>, Emma!<br>
<i>Judy</i><b title='used to add information that shows that what you have just said is true'>After all</b>, my parents died very young.<br>
<i>Jack</i>And my <b title='a substance in your blood that can cause heart disease if you have too much of it [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol">Wiki</a>]'>cholesterol</b>'s off the charts!<br>
<i>Judy</i>Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women, too!<br>
<i>Ross (stops recording)</i>Ok, cut! Great. Great. That was... that was just... yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, um, don't forget to get a <b title='a short piece in a film in which there is a single action or a short series of actions'>shot</b> of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the <b title='↗refrigerator, freezer'>fridge</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, sure.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">Wiki</a>]'>New Jersey</b>, Corino's.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, my God, that place has the creamiest <b title='a sweet substance put on cakes and made from powdery sugar and butter =icing'>frosting</b>! I used to <b title='travel to places by getting free rides from drivers of passing cars ↗hike, trek'>hitchhike</b> there when I was a kid.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, anyway, they make these great <b title='sth new and unusual ↗novel, fiction'>novelty</b> cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! On a cake shaped like a <b title='rabbit, used esp by or to children'>bunny</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, Rach? Does this bakery <b title='used when you are asking questions to find out whether sth is true'>by any chance</b> also bake <b title='containing scenes or descriptions that make you sexually excited ↗porn, obscene, dirty, filthy, lewd'>erotic</b> cakes? <b title='used to mention sth as an example'>Say</b> for <b title='an unmarried woman'>bachelorette</b> parties?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) Oh, my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!<br>
<i>Phoebe (sees the cake)</i>Oh! Now it's a party!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='used to express surprise or annoyance'>Why</b> you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would've baked it myself!<br>
<i>Joey (staring at the cake)</i>Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?<br>
<i>Judy</i>Jack, look at this.<br>
<i>Jack</i>I know what you're thinking Judy, the <b title='similarity'>resemblance</b> is <b title='strange and mysterious'>uncanny</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am this close to <b title='tug - pull sb/sth by making a short strong movement ↗tuck'>tugging</b> on my testicles again.<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to say a situation has developed in an unexpected and sometimes humorous way ↗sarcastically'>Ironically</b>, that was the <b title='a well-known phrase or saying ↗moral, maximum, Marxism'>maxim</b> thing.<br>
<i>Rachel (on the phone)</i>No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">Wiki</a>] <img src="270px-New_Jersey_in_United_States.svg-1.png" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/New_Jersey_in_United_States.svg/270px-New_Jersey_in_United_States.svg.png">'>New Jersey</b> so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! <b title='used for emphasizing that what you are saying is true, esp when you are warning sb about sth'>Believe you me</b>! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm so <b title='↗puzzled, bemused, bewildered, perplexed'>confused</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughter's picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='↗in their defense'>To be fair</b> this one does have <b title='testicles =balls'>nuts</b>.

<s>Later... Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, Mon, that was really nice of you to <b title='lend'>loan</b> Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair <b title='until'>till</b> I dropped the key!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?<br>
<i>Monica</i>We're Aunt Monica and Uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of <b title='if a system, plan, organization etc unravels, it starts to fail'>unraveled</b>. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thanks, another good one. I can't believe I taped over my <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29">Wiki</a>]'>Big Brother</b> <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b> for this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if-if we wanna get to Vermont.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Uh I called them, last train leaves in a half hour.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>And you know, I have a massage client soon.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You guys, just, please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake <b title='very soon'>any minute</b>. Monica, remember.. the frosting? Uh?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Alright, 5 more minutes.<br>
(The phone rings, Ross picks up)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok, ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be <b title='immediately'>right</b> there. (Puts the phone down)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Was that Emma? Is she <b title='not in bed'>up</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, Rachel got <b title='pull over - drive to the side of the road and stop your car, or to make sb else do this ↗pull away/off/up'>pulled over</b> for speeding. She forgot her <b title="driver's license">licence</b> so now I have to bring it to her.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! Wait! If anybody <b title='get to - have the opportunity to do sth'>gets to</b> go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, wait! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's <b title='mess up - ruin/spoil'>messed up</b>. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!<br>

<i>Joey</i><b title='Understand'>Got it</b>! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where'd you think you're going?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>To the bathroom!<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='=All right'>Alright</b>, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Yelling) What're you doing? Get <b title='used for showing that you are angry or annoyed'>the hell</b> out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, it did not.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Judy</i>Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his <b title='one of the parts that a wide road or highway is divided into'>lane</b>.<br>
<i>Jack</i>The last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a <b title='a long low open container that horses or cows eat from ↗Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary'>manger</b> scene. The papers thought it was a <b title="usu defined by state law as one that involves threats, harassment, or physical harm and is motivated by prejudice against sb's race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation or physical or mental disability">hate crime</b>.<br>
<i>Judy</i>Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok! (Opens the door for them)<br>
<i>Judy</i>Bye... Bye dear.<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="Good night. usu said when it's late into the night.">Nighty-night</b>!<br>
<i>Judy</i>Nighty-night!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Bye-bye.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Joey? How could you just let them leave?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey hey hey! I'm not gonna <b title='mess with sb - make sb angry or argue with them'>mess with Jack</b>, he's a great man, he fought for our country.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, he didn't! He pretended to be a <b title='a member of the Society of Friends, a Christian religious group that meets without any formal ceremony and is strongly opposed to violence and war [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker">Wiki</a>]'>Quaker</b> to get out of Korea.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Shocked) Oh! Well <b title='used to say that sth has ended or when you are angry about a situation and you do not want it to continue'>that's it</b>! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the <b title='bolt - a metal bar that you slide across a door or window in order to lock it'>bolts</b> of the door, <b title='with the result that sth else happens'>thereby</b> locking it)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> know I can just turn them the other way around, right?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! I forgot you used to live here!<br>
(The phone rings, Joey picks up)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hello?<br>
<i>Estelle</i>(on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! (smiles)<br>
<i>Estelle</i>So, how did your audition <b title='happen/develop'>go</b> today?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(smile <b title='fade - gradually disappear'>fades</b>) What audition?<br>
<i>Estelle</i>The one I told you about last week?<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? You never said anything about an audition!<br>
<i>Estelle</i>(Looks confused) Let me <b title='start doing sth again from the beginning'>start over</b>. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still <b title='be able to be present at a particular event'>make it</b>. It's down at the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Theatre">Wiki</a>]'>Astor Theatre</b> and you need to have a <b title='long speech in a play, film, etc spoken by one actor, esp when alone ↗dialog, dialogue'>monologue</b> prepared.<br>
<i>Joey</i>A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna <b title='leave'>take off</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! no! Let's <b title='think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figure out</b> a fair way to decide who's staying.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! I got <b title='an/the idea'>it</b>! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, Monica picks ten, I <b title='demand'>call</b> nine! Anyone else?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, let's, let's just draw straws.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm begging you stop.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Right.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, how about this: We got <b title='a wind-up toy or machine is one that works when you turn a key several times ↗clockwork'>wind-up</b> toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Visibly excited) Yeah! Let's do that!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were gonna do in Vermont!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok! I want the <b title='a very intelligent sea animal like a fish <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Bottlenose_Dolphin_KSC04pd0178.jpg/250px-Bottlenose_Dolphin_KSC04pd0178.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin">Wiki</a>]'>dolphin</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thats a bear.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm too excited!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. Alright, Phoebe, you get the bear, uh, Joey, you get the <b title='↗android, C-3PO, R2-D2, RoboCop'>robot</b>, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, ladies and gentlemen, <b title='/waind/ turn part of a machine around several times, in order to make it move or start working'>wind</b> your toys! (they do so)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, on your mark... <b title='ready to do sth'>Get set</b>... GO!<br>
(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Go! Go!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on robot!<br>
(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts <b title='when a dog barks, it makes a short loud sound or series of sounds ↗woof, meow, purr, moo, baa, oink'>barking</b>, sits, walks again, and so on... )<br>
<i>Monica</i>(to the dog) What are you barking at?<br>
(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a <b title='a backward somersault (a rolling movement or jump)'>backflip</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?<br>
(<b title='in the meantime'>Meanwhile</b> the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='used for telling sb that they have done sth well, or that you are proud of their achievement'>Way to go</b> robot!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Good job <b title="She's already named the bear">Alan</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, <b title='↗good game'>good race</b> you guys.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, see you later!<br>
(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so <b title='according to a strict way of understanding the meaning of a rule or set of facts'>technically</b>...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>They left.<br>
(Monica turns to see the closed door.)

Ross is sitting next to her.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>(into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma that we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye... <br>
(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car <b title='change direction suddenly'>swerve</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>RACHEL!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>OOH! God! Sorry!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a <b title='an official piece of paper that shows a driver they must pay money for committing a traffic offense'>ticket</b>. You're such a good driver.<br>
(Ross fastens his seat belt.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Emma's awake.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid <b title='offensive in a sexual way'>obscene</b> cake.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to, try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back <b title='The cover of a book or a magazine is the outside part of it'>cover</b> of that book that you gave me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach, she's not gonna remember this.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER! (<b title='honk - make a loud noise using a horn, esp the horn of a car.'>honks</b> <b title='furious - extremely angry ↗indignant'>furiously</b>, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looks back at the cake) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's not bad.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, I just made <b title='balls'>these two things</b> uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I'm very impressed.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Some can sing, some can dance. I <b title='according to a situation appears'>apparently</b> can turn <b title='like or relating to a phallus (penis)'>phallic</b> cakes into <b title='an area of land covered with trees'>woodland</b> creatures.
<s>Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. <br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Game?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.<br>
(With his <b title='↗thumb, middle finger, ring finger, little finger, pinkie'>index finger</b> he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and <b title='babble - talk/say in a confused or excited way'>babbles</b>...)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ooh! That's my girl!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's how old you are.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did I teach her that? Did I just... <b title='give sth such as information, knowledge, or beliefs to sb'>impart</b> wisdom?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='↗hug, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>embraces</b> Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Me too...<br>
(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?<br>
<i>Monica</i>...and <b title='go in particular direction'>head</b> to Canada!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was kidding.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I wasn't. Let's get going!<br>
(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, not yet.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh good, I didn't miss the party.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What about your massage client?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just <b title='slip - give sb sth secretly or without attracting much attention'>slipped</b> him a little something, you know. <b title='on the condition that'>As long as</b> I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.<br>
(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!<br>
(Ross and Rachel enter.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, guys! Come on! You <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> see what Emma just did.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)<br>
<i>Emma</i>Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)<br>
(Ross and Rachel <b title='↗inhale, exhale'>gasp</b>)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh my God! Our daughter's a <b title='sb who is much more intelligent or skillful than other people ↗genuine, gene, genie'>genius</b>! Rach, this means...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(angrily) NO, no science <b title='a place where young people go to take part in activities, and where they usu stay for several days or weeks'>camp</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used when you are annoyed'>Damn it</b>! I'll put a candle on the cake.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Thanks!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>! Emma's first birthday cake... go ahead, blow out the candle.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah come on Emma, you can do it, come on.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, that's a candle.<br>
(Rachel wipes away some tears.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's wrong? Are you ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
<s>Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. They put the camera on a <b title='an object with three legs that is used for supporting sth such as a camera ↗tricycle, triplet'>tripod</b> in the kitchen and they are standing in front of the camera.</s>

<i>Rachel</i>Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...<br>

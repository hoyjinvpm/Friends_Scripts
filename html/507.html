<i>Joey</i>Uh it's perfect!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) How about you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's a kitchen slash bathroom.<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right, I <b title='understand'>see</b> what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs fill out an application.<br>
(He exits.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We are bad people.<br>
<i>Joey</i>He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
<s>Central Perk, Phoebe is there waiting for Larry.</s>
<i>Larry</i>(entering) Hey, ready for dinner?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, absolutely!<br>
<i>Larry</i>Great! Uh you wanted to go the Italian place down on <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeker_Street">Wiki</a>]'>Bleaker Street</b> right?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.<br>
<i>Larry</i>Oh. How about Mama Lisettie's?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Enh. Sure!<br>
<i>Larry</i>(notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) 's been <b title='set - put'>setting</b> out.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, no, no, this place is totally healthy! That- this milk is mine. I bought this, today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, you know. (She takes a <b title='drink sth in large mouthfuls (also a noun) ↗gulp, down, sip'>swig</b> of it, but has to turn away from him as she <b title='If you make a face, you show a feeling such as dislike or disgust by putting an exaggerated expression on your face'>makes a face</b> to show that it has <b title='go bad - become unfit for consumption or use'>gone bad</b>.) Ok, let's go!<br>
(Just as they're about to leave, Gunther comes out of the back carrying two garbage bags. Larry sees this and stops him.)<br>
<i>Larry</i>Hey, <b title='used to address sb'>buddy</b>! (Flashes his badge.) You familiar with the uh Section 11-B of the Health <b title='a set of rules, laws, or principles that tell people how to behave'>Code</b> that requires all <b title="{formal} waste material /'refju:s/ ↗trash, garbage, dumpster">refuse</b> material be taken out the back exit?<br>
<i>Gunther</i>But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.<br>
<i>Larry</i>Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Would you be interested in a...free coffee?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, stop! Larry, ok, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? You know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, ok, so where are we gonna eat <b title='used in questions beginning with words such as "why", "when", and "who" when you want to emphasize your surprise or shock'>ever</b>?<br>
<i>Larry</i>Well, I suppose I could, give him a warning.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Ok, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to <b title='if the police bust sb, they charge them with a crime'>bust</b> someone, I know a hot dog <b title='sb who sells things, esp on the street'>vendor</b> who <b title='pick nose - remove dirt from your nose with your finger ↗snot, bogie, bogey'>picks his nose</b>.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are <b title='lament - show that you feel sad or disappointed ↗regret, guilty'>lamenting</b> about how they kicked Ross out.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross <b title='get back on your foot - be successful again after having problems'>get back on his feet</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yes, that was a nice place!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are we gonna do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know. Maybe pizza?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>About Ross!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh! Oh!<br>
(The phone rings and Joey answers it.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hello! (Listens.) Oh, yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross <b title='put down =write down'>put us down</b> as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.<br>

(Listens.) <b title='That is the way things are, just like I told you'>There you go</b>! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?<br>
(The apartment manager hung up on him and he hangs up the phone and throws in on the chair. Joey motions, "What the hell was that?" Chandler makes a face to say, "Think about it." Joey tries to divide 136 by 13; he's confused. Suddenly, light <b title='if day or morning dawns, it begins ↗dusk'>dawns</b> on <b title='over there'>yonder</b> <b title='stupid person ↗bonehead, dork, doofus'>dunder</b> head.

<i>Rachel</i>Shh-shh! this is never gonna work. He's right there.<br>

So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)<br>
<i>Danny</i>Salad.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)<br>
<i>Danny</i>Bread. Aren't you, aren't you a chef?<br>
(Rachel returns.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.<br>
<i>Danny</i>Hey! Rachel!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.<br>
<i>Danny</i>Oh wow, you look great! I'm-I'm glad you could <b title='succeed in getting somewhere in time for sth'>make it</b>.<br>

<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are there as Ross enters.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey! I just got my uh, teacher evaluations! <b title='Look at, get information'>Check out</b> what this <b title='used to emphasize a particular person or thing'>one</b> student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. <b title='causing mental excitement, ecstasy etc'>Mind-blowing</b> lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the <b title='sb who is very sexually attractive ↗cute, cutie'>hottie</b> of the <b title='the study of fossils'>paleontology</b> department!"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a <b title='popular/successful'>big</b> selling <b title='wall/desk calendar.'>calendar</b>, eh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who wrote it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all <b title='unknown by name'>anonymous</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, <b title='because'>'cause</b> you could just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and <b title='↗bam'>boom</b>, there's your admirer. (Ross is <b title='too surprised or shocked to speak'>stunned</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>A <b title='sexually attractive'>hot</b> girl's <b title='if sth that you value very much is at stake, you will lose it if a plan or action is not successful ↗bet, gamble, jeopardize'>at stake</b> and <b title='suddenly'>all of a sudden</b> <b title='Joey'>he</b>'s <b title='a 1988 American drama film...

<i>Rachel</i>Ok, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's a girl! Anyway, it wou- it wouldn't matter. Ok? Because I'm-I'm a teacher, she is, a student.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, is that against the rules?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, but it is <b title='disapproved'>frowned upon</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I see.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Besides, there's a big age difference.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, that's not what I was <b title='going to'>gonna</b> say at all. No, what I was gonna say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

<i>Joey</i>(entering) Hey, Chandler! You know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='sarcastic - saying the opposite of what you really mean in order to make fun of sb'>sarcastically</b>) Thank you.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>She doesn't know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.<br>

(Rachel dials her number.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the <b title='a group of people'>gang</b>.) Great, someone is in our apartment. CALL, the cops!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! How bad was it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe, come on! (The girls all run out and Joey <b title='hold up - delay'>holds up</b> Chandler by smiling.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What are you smiling about? What is so funny?<br>

<i>Elizabeth</i>Professor Geller?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='startle - make sb suddenly surprised or slightly shocked'>startled</b>) Yeah, well?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a <b title='drawing pin'>thumbtack</b>.) Ow! (He <b title="pull away - move sb's body away">pulls away</b>.)<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...<br>
<i>Ross</i>That was you?<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe wanna <b title='↗flirt, hit on, ask out, date'>go out</b> with me sometime?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.<br>
<i>Elizabeth</i>Oh, 'cause I was thinking, uh, the semester is over; you're not my teacher <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What time?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Coming through! (Has to <b title='move quickly to avoid'>dodge</b> a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!<br>
(They start to look around seeing that the living room is undamaged.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, ok, well, it's not so bad.<br>
<i>Fireman #1</i>Yeah, most of the damage is <b title='almost completely'>pretty much</b> contained in the bedrooms.<br>

<i>Fireman #1</i>Excuse me?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.<br>
(Phoebe and Rachel return)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, how bad is it?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an <b title="Fireman's axe">ax</b>, which I do not remember buying!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How's your room Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Isn't that mine?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Fine! I'm sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)<br>
<i>Fireman #1</i>So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?<br>

<i>Fireman #1</i>No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn <b title='a substance which has a pleasant smell when you burn it'>incense</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Ohh! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Ok? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.

<i>Chandler</i>Ok! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... (Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you <b title='wait'>hold on</b> for one second please? (To Joey) What?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>When you're off the phone, you wanna get a pizza?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(on phone) Hi! I'm back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Ok. Well, we'll do it then. (Listens) Ok, bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?<br>
(Monica enters.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Joey) We didn't <b title='reach a particular point or stage of sth'>get to</b> the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> we'll do it then.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ah-ha!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow! So, now you're going on a <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> with this girl?<br>

<i>Monica</i>You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're you know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, we only went out once.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You dated her!<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='used to emphasize that sth has never happened =never once'>Not once</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend you know, and you know, do Joey a favor?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)

<i>Monica</i>I know! Now, look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, since the fire was <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> stay here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Hey-hey, <b title="used to get sb's attention">now</b>, this was no one's fault, Pheebs. Ok? It was an accident.<br>

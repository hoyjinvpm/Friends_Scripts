<i>Monica</i>Is everything all right?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, everything's great, just watching some regular television there, aw, what-what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, She knows he was <b title='↗touch oneself'>masturbating</b>, but he has changed the channel to a nature program about sharks.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Nooo!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

<i>Rachel</i>Well, watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that? Believe me, I know what he was doing.<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='used as an exclamation'>Man</b>, sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that <b title='used to address sb ↗fella, buddy'>dude</b>. But you promised to love him no matter what.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What means like if he gets like a disease or kills someone.

<i>Rachel</i>Ah! You know what hell honey? Guys are just different. They like things that we can't understand. You know, I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend that he was an <b title='archaeology - the study of ancient societies by examining what remains of their buildings, graves, tools etc'>archeologist</b> and that I was this naughty cave woman who he unfroze from a block of ice.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Eww, are-are you talking about my bother?<br>

<i>Joey</i>(Enters) Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Listen to this... I went out with this girl last night. Half way through our date, I realized, I already slept with her!<br>
(Monica makes a strange <b title='expression'>face</b> and sits down)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>So basically, you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going <b title='moving in a circle'>around</b> again.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>But you don't remember sleeping with her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, but she should remember sleeping with me! I am very memorable, you guys know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What, how do we know, we never slept with you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And whose fault is that?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an <b title='not up to standard; below a normal or satisfactory level'>off</b> night.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! I never have an off night, OK, although, sometimes if I'm a little <b title='swollen with fat etc ↗put on weight'>bloated</b> I don't feel that sexy, but even that I'm better than most!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, why don't you just <b title='let go - stop holding/thinking/worrying etc sth'>let it go</b> and <b title='ask out - ask sb to go to a movie, a restaurant etc with you'>ask her out</b> again?<br>

(Ross knocks at the door.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>It's open.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey! Mike called, we're going out again! Yay! Yay! (She dances)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yay! Quick thing, Um, I went to talk to Mike.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? Wh-what did you, what did you do, Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>boy</b>, you got mad at that part. I-I went over there you know to-to tell him how-how great you are, but, well you-you know me, <b title='used to refer to sth that is said or written without giving the actual words ↗talkative, expansive'>blah blah blah</b>, and I-I ended up telling him, um...that....<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Umm... you had a six-year-long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What? Why!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, he seemed <b title='sad. also "bummed out"'>bummed</b> hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend, I swear to <b title='Satan before his fall ↗devil, evil [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Wiki</a>]'>Lucifer</b>, a <b title='suffering from rabies [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies">Wiki</a>]'>rabid</b> dog would be <b title='feast - eat a lot of a particular food with great enjoyment'>feasting</b> on your <b title='dangle - hang or swing loosely ↗tinkle, schwang, penis, balls, testicles, 007'>danglers</b> <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well Phoebe, I think you'll feel differently when you know a little bit about Vicrum. Ok, he's a, um, he's a kite designer! And he used to date <b title='an American talk show host [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah">Wiki</a>]'>Oprah</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm not <b title='go along with - agree with/support'>going along with</b> some lie you <b title='make up - invent, esp to deceive sb'>made up</b>, Ross. No, I'm just, I'm just gonna be honest with him.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Good, yeah, just-just be honest with him.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I've nothing to be ashamed of. OK, so, all right, I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. OK, I-I haven't had a real boyfriend. You know, if he can't handle that, then he can leave. Which he will, and you know, that's OK. So, I'll just be <b title='↗lonely'>alone</b> forever, you know, <b title='=all right'>alright</b>, I'll be... it'll be fine, it'll be fine. I'll go on, I'll go on walking tours with <b title='widower - a man whose wife has died and who has not married again'>widows</b> and <b title='↗straight, gay, homosexual, heterosexual, come out (the closet)'>lesbians</b>.<br>
(Knock on door.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'll get it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>OK.<br>
<i>Mike</i>(To Ross.) I'm trying to remember the last time I opened a door and you weren't there. Phoebe, are you OK?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh huh, yeah. There's just, umm, there's something you should know.... Vicrum just called.

<i>Hayley</i>So it was really a shock. After 25 years of marriage, my parents, a perfect couple, are getting divorced. I <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='take - accept'>took</b> it the hardest <b title='because'>'cause</b> I was the youngest.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?<br>
<i>Hayley</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>How could you not remember that we slept together?<br>
<i>Hayley</i>What! When?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know!<br>
<i>Hayley</i>I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on, come on, search your brain. All right. it was ... a certain amount of time ago, ok, I was here, you were here, we had sex (Pointing) here, here, here, not there. Anything?<br>
<i>Hayley</i>No, it's not <b title='ring a bell - cause sb to remember sth'>ringing any bells</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>My God, woman! How many people do you have to have been with not to remember any of this?<br>
<i>Hayley's <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b></i>(Enters) Hey Hayley, you've really <b title='got to'>gotta</b> fix that doorknob. Joey?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oooooh, I slept with you! And you <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> remember me. Hey! I still got <b title='the quality of being memorable'>it</b>. (To Hayley) So <b title="Everything is ok">we're good</b>. (She just glares at him) I'll let myself out.
<s>Phoebe's Place.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>...and I-I said, ok, Vicrum, you can't just call every time you get lonely, you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.<br>
<i>Mike</i>But Rachel, I thought she just had a baby with Ross.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, well (pause) yeah, you know, but Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say <b title='Vicrum Mookurgee'>Mookurgee</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>That is so wrong and <b title='adding this to that'>on top of that</b> he's a <b title='glue sniffing - the inhaling of the fumes of certain kinds of glue for the hallucinogenic (seeing sth that is not really ) or euphoric (feeling very happy and excited) effects they produce, often resulting in damage to various organs'>glue sniffer</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know but he calls and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one <b title='↗small talk, slick'>smooth-talking</b> <b title='working independently for different companies ↗moonlight, part-time'>freelance</b> kite designer.<br>
<i>Mike</i>If you want, you know, I'll <b title='mess sb up - hurt sb esp by hitting them ↗kick ass, hunt down'>mess him up</b> for you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You would do that?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah! Unless he's big. I mean, if he's really big, I'll send the <b title='sb who has no home or job'>bum</b>... a rude letter. I just, I think there's somebody better out there for you, (pause) I mean you know, I'm not saying me, but...maybe me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Mike</i>And you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. Although I do smell the occasional <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Marker">Marker pen</a>]'>magic marker</b>, yeah. Ah anyway, I just, I think I can make you happy.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>OK I can't do this.<br>
<i>Mike</i>What's wrong?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I-I really never have been in a long-term relationship, I've never, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an <b title='a date on which sth special or important happened in a previous year'>anniversary</b> so... you know if that's, that's too weird for you and-and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll-I'll close my eyes, make it less awkward (She sits, eyes closed. Mike kisses her.) You kissed me.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Uh huh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So you don't think I'm a total <b title='sb who is strange or different ↗weirdo, creep, maniac, pervert'>freak</b>.<br>
<i>Mike</i>No. Well... look, can I, can I think you're a little weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I guess so, can I, can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again? And umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Definitely.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(On phone, in <b title='↗dialect'>accent</b>) This is Vicrum. I need to talk to you about the long-term relationship we had. Call me. I am in my kite-making studio.

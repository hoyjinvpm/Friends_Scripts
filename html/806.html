<i>Monica</i>Hey guys, guess what?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Well, I'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day <b title='whatever else is happening'>anyway</b> so...<br>

<i>Ursula</i>Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Hi!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won't be able to fit into it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. Oh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm <b title="a fictional character associated with DC Comics' Batman franchise [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman'>Wiki</a>]">Catwoman</b>, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.<br>

<i>Witch</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)<br>
<i>Clown</i>Thank you.<br>

<i>Cowgirl</i>(interrupting) Can I just have the candy?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! I thought he'd love it!

<i>Monica</i>You didn't dress up either?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes I did! I'm Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) <b title='used to address sb'>Dude</b>, what happened?<br>

<i>Monica</i>What?! There's only been like four kids.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to say that you are not surprised by sth'>No wonder</b> <b title='Ross said he loved you. So Bam!'>you're pregnant</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(entering) Hey! (He's wearing a costume as well.)<br>

<i>Ross</i>Remember the Russian satellite, <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik">Wiki</a>]'>Sputnik</b>? (They all look at him.) Well, I'm a potato or a...<b title='potato'>spud</b>. And these are my <b title='antenna - a wire or metal pole used for receiving or sending radio waves'>antennae</b>. (Points to the <b title='a bowl with small holes in that you put food into to remove any liquid ↗sieve, sift, funnel'>colander</b> with an old TV antenna glued on top that he's wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes... (They're still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! I don't have the worst costume <b title='any longer'>anymore</b>!<br>

<i>Eric</i>Ursula?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ursula's fiancé?<br>
<i>Eric</i>Oh my God, you're the sister!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Ok, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Eric</i>I'm an <b title='↗imbecile, retarded, moron, dork, doofus, bonehead'>idiot</b>. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>My mother <b title='↗commit suicide, homicide'>killed herself</b>.<br>
<i>Eric</i>She, and I knew that and...now I'm sweating. Look at me, I'm really sweating-Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier. I think I should probably just go.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No-no! That's ok, we'll just <b title='begin again from the beginning'>start over</b>. Ok? Hi! I'm Phoebe.<br>
<i>Eric</i>E-Eric. (They shake hands and he's <b title='squint - look at sth with your eyes partly closed'>squinting</b>.)<br>

<i>Eric</i>Thank you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used to express triumph, dismay, encouragement, etc'>There</b>. So, what are you?<br>
<i>Eric</i>I don't think they have a name for it. It's just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.<br>

(He's wearing a black sweater with the planets glued on around the sun.) Yeah, my students helped me make it-I teach the second grade.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I love the second grade!<br>
<i>Eric</i>Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. You know with all the politics and mind games.<br>
<i>Eric</i>So what'd you do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm, I'm a masseuse...<b title='during the day'>by day</b>. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)<br>
<i>Eric</i>You-you know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Oh I feel very lucky, she's great. I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Will you relax?! What're you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh really? Ok? Well what would you say if I told you that, you know, Ross or Chandler could <b title='beat up - hurt sb badly by hitting them'>beat you up</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I would say, "Woman, <b title='said when you think what sb has just said is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>!"<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(walking over) Hey. Ursula's fiancé is really <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Joey) Do you think you could take him?<br>
<i>Joey</i>The dude with the balls on his chest? I think so.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But what is he doing with my sister? He's so great. He's a teacher, he does all this <b title='sb who is not paid for the work that they do ↗missionary'>volunteer</b> work. You know normally, you know, I don't like really <b title='-y - full of, covered in'>sweaty</b> guys. But this one?

<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>

(They start to fight with Ross pulling on Chandler's ears and Chandler hitting Ross over the head with his carrot.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wait-wait! Ok, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let's give <b title='them'>'em</b> what they came for!<br>
<i>Mona</i>Hey, you guys could <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_wrestle">Wiki</a>]'>arm wrestle</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) You're <b title='go down - be defeated'>going down</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh yeah? You're going further down! Downtown!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Seriously guys, the <b title='negative or insulting things that you say to or about sb, esp an opponent'>trash talk</b> is embarrassing.
<s>Monica and Chandler's, the party continues with Rachel leaning on the counter as Gunther walks in carrying candy.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for <b title='pick sth up - get sth'>picking this up</b>! You are so sweet.<br>
<i>Gunther</i>Really?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.<br>
(There's a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Kid</i>Trick or treat!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='have got to'>Gotta</b> go! (Opens the door to a boy in a <b title='a loose piece of clothing without sleeves that hangs from your shoulders, a short cloak'>cape</b>.) Hi! Wow! <b title='used when giving sth to sb or when you have done sth for sb ↗here you go'>There you go</b>! (Hands him some candy.)<br>
<i>Boy in the Cape</i>My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we <b title='used for saying have in informal speech'>got</b> candy.<br>
<i>Boy in the Cape</i>I'd rather have the money.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!<br>
<i>Boy in the Cape</i>This isn't fair.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free <b title='things'>stuff</b>?<br>
<i>Boy in the Cape</i>Shut up!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You shut up!<br>
(The <b title='group of people'>gang</b> gets interested now.)<br>
<i>Boy in the Cape</i>You can't tell me to shut up!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Joey) Yeah, oh I got-I'm <b title='cool, relaxed'>good</b>-<b title='I can handle this'>I got it</b>! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, I've one more thing I'd say to you...oh right! Shut up!<br>
<i>Boy in the Cape</i>You're a <b title='unkind, cruel'>mean</b> old woman. (Runs away.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)<br>
[Cut to Mona and Joey clearing the dining room table for the grudge match between Chandler and Ross.]<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Chandler) Look, honey, you don't have to do this, ok? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. I mean, You're loyal, and you're honest, and you have <b title='the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles'>integrity</b>! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
<s>The <b title='corridor'>Hallway</b>, Phoebe is exiting Monica and Chandler's, and finds Ursula standing in the hallway smoking.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi liar!<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Well they could be true.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But they're not!<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Yeah, it's a <b title='narrow'>fine</b> line huh?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why are you lying to him?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>I don't know. He said he did all this stuff <b title='used to say what happens next'>and then</b> I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you can't do this, you're gonna ruin his life.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Why are you taking this so seriously? It's just a marriage. Besides, If I cheat on him, I can call it an affair!<br>
<i>Eric</i>(entering) Honey?<br>
<i>Ursula</i>(waving the cigarette in Phoebe's face) It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!<br>
<i>Eric</i>She's helped so many people to quit smoking.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>You know, we'd really better get going.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Oh right, you have a church group meeting tonight.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Right. (Walks down the stairs.)<br>
<i>Eric</i>(To Phoebe) Well, it was nice meeting you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Ok. Ok guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each other's hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What's the winner get?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Pride.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And <b title='the fact of being respected or deserving respect ↗indignity, self-respect, self-esteem'>dignity</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(laughing) Ok, if you say so. All right, ready? <b title='(get) ready ↗On your marks'>Set</b>! Go!<br>
(They start wrestling, only they are unable to move either one's arm despite a huge <b title='pressure'>strain</b> on their faces and a cheering crowd.)<br>
<i>[Time Lapse</i>the crowd has left and only Mona, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are still watching to see who will be able to move the other's arm first. An event that has yet to happen.]<br>
<i>Mona</i>(To Joey) Wow! They're both really strong.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Or equally weak.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(To Phoebe) Oh God!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hmm?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler's making his sex face.<br>
(Basically Chandler's face looks like he's not all there and is staring off into the distance...)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Chandler) So, you getting tired?<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title='No'>Nope</b>! I can do this all day.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Getting a little tired though.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>God, I'm <b title='↗worn out'>exhausted</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, this is starting to look really bad for me. Ok? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh, God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No way! <b title='used during a conversation when you are trying to make a suggestion, change the subject, or interrupt sb else'>If anything</b> you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a <b title='sb who is not strong, brave or confident ↗wuss, sissy'>wimp</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and <b title='knock sb up - make sb pregnant'>knocking people up</b>! And I'm dressed as doody.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You're Sputnik.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used for telling sb that you do not believe what they are saying'>Come on</b>, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watching.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(celebrating) Oh yeah!<br>
<i>Mona</i>(clapping) Yay! My hero!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to her) You're a weird lady.<br>
<i>Eric</i>(entering) Hey. Ursula said she left her <b title='handbag'>purse</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Eric</i>(finds it) Oh, what a <b title='the feeling of happiness that you have when sth unpleasant does not happen'>relief</b>. It has all the numbers of the people in her <b title='a general prayer chain is a network of individuals who will receive prayer requests and thanksgivings, forward them to the next available person in the network, and will pray immediately for each request.'>prayer chain</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.<br>
<i>Eric</i>Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding. (Exits and Phoebe follows him into the hall.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So, I just wanna wish you all the luck in the world, and I also wanna give you a little piece of advice, that I give to everyone who's getting married: Um, don't trust you wife.<br>
<i>Eric</i>I think we'll be ok. It's so perfect and (whispering) she's been <b title='no sex until married'>saving herself for me</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.<br>
<i>Eric</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>She is lying! And <b title='used to say you are sure about sth'>I bet</b> I can prove it. <b title='excuse'>'Scuse</b> me. (She grabs Ursula's purse and starts <b title='go through - search, examine'>going through</b> it and finds some papers.) Ok. Ok. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor <b title='a drawing similar to a map'>plan</b>. (Holds up her <b title='↗badge'>nametag</b>.) Ok, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this <b title='ought to'>oughta</b> be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?<br>
<i>Eric</i>She told me she was 25.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I almost don't wanna show you this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember, I'm a minute younger.<br>
<i>Eric</i>I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret <b title='a school in which children receive the first stage of compulsory education known as primary or elementary education =primary school'>elementary school</b> for the children of spies.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No. You're not, you're not stupid.<br>
<i>Eric</i>I'm not smart. (Phoebe has no <b title='a quick reply ↗talk back, back talk, retort'>comeback</b>.) I just wanted so much to...be impulsive for once. To be romantic.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?<br>
<i>Eric</i>It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, so different.<br>
<i>Ursula</i>(yelling from downstairs) Eric! Let's go!<br>
<i>Eric</i>I'd better go, deal<b title='with it'>...</b><br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)<br>
<i>Ursula</i>Hurry up, I gotta pray!<br>
(Phoebe hands Eric Ursula's purse and he walks away.)<br>
[Time Lapse, Rachel is returning from chasing down the boy in the cape.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty <b title='dollars'>bucks</b> to stop crying.<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's not so bad.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, I also had to go to a couple of houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I'm just awful with children!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. You know, they're all <b title='wanting more food, money, power etc'>greedy</b> and hopped up on sugar!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? You think that's all it is?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. They <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> get a little crazy during the summer, too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. You know, kids are <b title='difficult to deal with'>tough</b>. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Monica are standing in the kitchen.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Look, I wanted to tell you I'm-I'm <b title='feeling pity/sympathy'>sorry</b> you lost.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, listen, I got a secret for <b title='you'>ya</b>. I let him win.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, I let him win-Ross!<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Would you tell her that I let you win please?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh. Yeah. (<b title='sarcastic - saying the opposite of what you mean, or speaking in a way intended to make sb else feel stupid'>sarcastic</b>Sarcastically</b>) Uh Chandler let me win.

<i>Monica</i>Chandler please!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Let's go big bunny!<br>
(They <b title='take on, adopt'>assume</b> the starting position.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. 1...2...3-Go! (Once again he's at a <b title='a position in chess in which neither player can win ↗checkmate'>stalemate</b>, but this time he's in pain.) (Pause) I'm gonna kill myself!<br>

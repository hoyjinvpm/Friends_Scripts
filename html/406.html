<i>Chandler</i>Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, <b title="used to encourage sb to approach. It's sometimes a sexual invitation">come to papa</b>.<br>
(Cheryl walks away and Ross walks inside. Everyone <b title='↗glare, gaze, glimpse, glance'>stares</b> at him in disbelief.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I know!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Probably the only time I'll <b title='at any time'>ever</b> say this, but did you see the <b title='↗arse, bottom, buttock, butt, posterior, rear, tush, tushie, tushy'>ass</b> on her?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a <b title='an appealing person who is hired to speak on behalf of a company or product, as in a commercial'>spokesmodel</b>, or an <b title='a very active type of physical exercise done to music ↗yoga'>aerobics</b> instructor, what?<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! Is it for my birthday present?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs, it was your birthday, like, months ago.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, I have a call in about that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, <b title="The Velveteen Rabbit (or How Toys Become Real) is a children's novel written by Margery Williams and illustrated by William Nicholson.

<i>Rachel</i>Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is <b title='fairly/rather/quite/very'>pretty</b> rare. How did you get that?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, honey, that's so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing'>sweet</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b>'s girlfriend!"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It doesn't say that. Does it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! What happened?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Sixty guests.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, what is with all the <b title='↗optimism, pessimism'>negativity</b>? God, you sound like Moni-can't , not Moni-can... (Monica looks almost puzzled) (Phoebe thinks about it) ...Moni-ca. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?<br>

Ok! <b title="used when getting sb's attention before continuing what you are saying">Now</b>, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok! It's worth it, if it'll get you moving. You haven't worked in months.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, you're not working either.<br>

<i>Kathy</i>Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's ok, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What're you getting Kathy for her birthday?<br>
<i>Joey</i>We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> get her something?<br>
<i>Everyone</i>Yes! Yeah!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.<br>

(Cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe is nearby.)<br>

<i>Monica</i>Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow - the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b> with Joey!"<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?<br>

<i>Joey</i>Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, so it's a card but it's also a poem-holder. (Joey points to Rachel as if she knows what he is talking about.)

<i>Monica</i>What?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, ok, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying.

<i>Joey</i>So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hmm.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, like that, only <b title='↗rather than, substitute'>instead of</b> a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Ok, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Any luck?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." (<b title='↗signal, gesture'>Motions</b> to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you get her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.<br>

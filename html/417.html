(Joey sits down and changes the channel, and we see two people <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa! Is this <b title='pornography (books etc that describe or show sexual acts in order to cause sexual excitement )'>porn</b>? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Do we pay for this?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, we didn't even pay our cable bill, maybe this is how they punish us.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill, free <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_sex">Wiki</a>]'>phone sex</b>.<br>

<i>Mr. Treeger</i>Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad. (Exits.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)

<i>Rachel</i>All right, You know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)<br>
<i>Joey and Chandler</i>(Stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We don't know what could make this go away.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And no one touches the <b title='↗atmosphere, aura'>air</b> around the TV!<br>

<i>Monica</i>I'm at least, going to <b title='make the sound of sth quieter, or make it disappear completely ↗turn down'>mute</b> it.<br>
<i>Joey and Chandler</i>Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they <b title='If you do or say sth tentatively, you do or say it in an uncertain way ↗confidence'>tentatively</b> look behind them)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We still have porn.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.<br>

<i>Ross</i>So uh, Emily just went to the airport.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh. Why didn't you take her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. You know, we-we said our goodbyes this morning, so...<br>
<i>Monica</i>You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Thinks about it.) Nah.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey, <b title='↗sadden, pump up'>cheer up</b>! You're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> see her again, right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I <b title='bring sth up - mention a subject or start to talk about it'>brought it up</b> with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so <b title='excellent, wonderful'>fantastic</b>! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Interrupting him) No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. It-it really <b title='bum sb out - annoy sb or make them disappointed'>bums me out</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Emily said I was pretty good.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well that's someone you should <b title='hold/keep'>hang on to</b>. You have to see her again.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Because! You could <b title='have the opportunity to'>get to</b> <b title='=live ↗help out, hang up'>live out</b> my <b title='a pleasant, exciting, or unusual experience that you imagine is happening to you ↗imagination, dream'>fantasy</b>!<br>

<i>Monica</i>Do you love her?<br>
<i>Ross</i>We said it was only gonna be two weeks, You know?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You love her!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What-what is love, really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the <b title='↗jetway'>gate</b>. You're gonna call out her name and yell, "I love you!" She's gonna say, "I love you too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will <b title='clap'>applaud</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I am a good kisser.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Then you two can, can sneak into the <b title='the area in a plane, small boat, or racing car where the pilot or driver sits [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit">Wiki</a>] <img src="220px-Airbus_A380_cockpit-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Airbus_A380_cockpit.jpg/220px-Airbus_A380_cockpit.jpg">'>cockpit</b>... things will start to heat up, and then a <b title='a female flight attendant'>stewardess</b> comes in...

<i>Rachel</i>Is that the heartbeat?<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>That's it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh wow! This is so cool.<br>
(The heartbeat changes, and we hear a different one.)<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?<br>

<i>The Doctor</i>Actually, giving birth to three babies is not that different from giving birth to one.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What do you know?! Have you ever had <b title='triplet - one of three children born to the same mother at the same time ↗twin'>triplets</b>?<br>
<i>The Doctor</i>No. I'm sorry. I haven't.<br>

<i>Frank</i>(They're <b title='to a smaller degree'>less than</b> happy now) Oh.<br>
<i>Alice</i>Right.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, back to happy. Back to happy!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Man, it's like a <b title='a place of horror, torture and even death in European legends and fairy tales. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_pit">Wiki</a>]'>snake pit</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on! Surprise her! <b title='arrive somewhere'>Show up</b> at her <b title='↗porch, doormat'>doorstep</b>! Don't let her go without a fight!<br>
<i>Ross</i>All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, good luck!<br>
(Ross starts to leave.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, can you <b title='pick up - get'>pick me up</b> another one of those Toblerone bars?
<s>Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can <b title='work around - arrange or organize sth so that you avoid problems that may stop you from doing sth'>work it around</b> his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's sounds great, but how are you gonna to afford it?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for <b title='cater - provide and serve food and drinks at a party, meeting etc, usu as a business'>catering</b> and we realized...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm telling it! I'm telling it!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to relax. So I just figured we could combine the two, ok, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can <b title='decorate/repair'>fix up</b> the van, <b title='fasten two things together using a bolt'>bolt</b> the table in the back, and you know what I've got?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>A place that no one will ever get out alive?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Interrupting) It's a relaxi-Taxi!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>The name was my favorite part!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, well I <b title='think of an idea, answer etc ↗make up, hit on'>came up with</b> it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I...<br>
(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hello.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on phone) Hey.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was-was Emily surprised?<br>
[Cut to Ross in one of those British phone <b title='a small enclosed box-like space that a person can go into'>booths</b>.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, 'cause she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's <b title='↗apparently, clearly, decidedly, evidently'>obviously</b> staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid <b title='↗idiot, imbecile, retarded'>moron</b> who spent the whole night outside her place! (Hits a window of the telephone booth)<br>
<i>Monica</i>What was that?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I just, I just put my fist through another wall. Tell the guys.<br>
<i>Monica</i>All right. When is, when is the next flight out?<br>
<i>Ross</i>About four hours.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home. Oh 'cause I just remembered, there's a girl at the restaurant that would be perfect for you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like <b title='=cab'>taxicab</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, that is better.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. Joey and Chandler are playing a card game. Monica is just coming out of the <b title='a room with a toilet in it'>restroom</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Do you have any <b title='↗diamonds, clubs, hearts, spades'>eights</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. (Monica looks at Joey's cards and pulls out an eight and hands it to Chandler.) (Joey stares at Monica.)<br>
(There is a knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are we in London?<br>
<i>Monica</i>What're you doing here? You can't be here!<br>
<i>Emily</i>I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.<br>
(She <b title='set - put'>sets</b> her bag down on the foosball table and Joey sees the Toblerone bar sticking out of it and <b title='gaze - stare ↗glare'>gazes</b> <b title='in a way that shows that you want sb/sth very much'>longingly</b> at it.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Pause) Nothing. No, nothing.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I was gonna call him, but...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I'm right, right?<br>
<i>Emily</i>I'd really rather talk to him.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh.<br>
<i>Emily</i>I uh, I've been to his apartment and he's not there, and uh I need to talk to him, so, do you have any idea where he is?<br>
[Cut to London, we sit Ross sitting outside Emily's apartment. We hear Emily's phone ring with amazing <b title='the quality of being clear and easy to see or hear'>clarity</b>. <b title='according to the way sb looks or a situation appears, although you cannot be sure'>Apparently</b>, sound travels quite easily through the walls of British buildings. <b title='anyway'>Anyhow</b>, Ross looks around for the ringing phone and <b title='meanwhile'>in the meantime</b> Emily's answering machine picks up and once again with amazing clarity we hear Emily say...]<br>
<i>Emily</i>Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in <b title='the U.S.'>the States</b> with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you- What, yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you, that I love you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you <b title='at the present time/immediately'>right now</b> from the phone booth! (Realizes) You can't hear me. (Goes to make his call.)<br>
<i>Emily</i>I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you that I love you or given my neighbors a good laugh. Mrs. Newman, if you're listening, <b title='go away or leave a place'>bugger off</b>, this is none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you <b title='do - used for emphasis'>did</b> hear that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Emily</i>Ross, I love you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ohh! Thank you.
<s>Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is still watching the porn as Chandler enters.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot <b title='sb whose job is to receive and pay out money in a bank. ATM=Automatic Teller Machine'>teller</b>, and she didn't ask me to go <b title='have sex'>do it</b> with her in the <b title='a room with thick walls and a strong door where money, jewels etc are kept ↗safe'>vault</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy comes over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What, no, "Nice apartment, <b title="used to say that you're fairly sure that sth is true">I bet</b> the bedrooms are huge?"<br>
<i>Joey</i>Noo! Nothing!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what, we have to turn off the porn.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I think you're right.<br>
(Goes over and picks up the remote.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, ready?<br>
<i>Joey</i>One.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Two.<br>
<i>Both</i>Three.<br>
(Chandler turns off the porn and sets the remote down.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>That's <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> nice.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, that's kind of a relief.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You wanna see if we still have it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah.<br>
(Chandler turns on the TV and...)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>FREE PORN!!!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We have free porn here!!!
<s>Beth Israel Medical Center. Phoebe is getting another <b title='an image, esp of a baby that is still inside the womb, which is produced by ultrasound'>sonogram</b>, but this time she is with Frank Jr. and Alice.</s>
<i>The Doctor</i>(Pointing to the sonogram) There's one, two, and three.<br>
<i>Alice</i>Oh my God!<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>Oh that's so beautiful. Oh, man.<br>
<i>Alice</i>I can't believe it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I know.<br>
<i>Frank Jr.</i>I like the middle one the best. (They all stare at him.) Don't worry, I won't let the other two know.<br>

<i>Mike's father</i>How's that?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know, on the one hand you're happy for <b title='them'>'em</b>, but on the other hand it's hard to <b title='stop holding sb/sth'>let go</b>.

(Cut to Ross, Chandler and Rachel)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, I thought we'd be <b title='groomsman - a man who helps the groom during a wedding ↗best man'>groomsmen</b>, but wouldn't they've asked us by now? (to Rachel) When did they ask you to be a <b title='↗maid of honor'>bridesmaid</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh... November?<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Heh.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, this is really awkward (<b title="↗glower, glare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk">staring</b> at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm sorry you guys. But, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were, you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just, you just missed the <b title='remainder of contestants in a competition, esp in golf, after some have been eliminated [<a href="http://golf.about.com/od/golfterms/g/miss-the-cut.htm">more</a>]'>cut</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Huh! Well then there are <b title='going to'>gonna</b> be a few surprises!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know, I <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> being <b title='leave out - to not include'>left out</b> of things.<br>
<i>Ross</i>And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey guys, how is it <b title='go - happen'>going</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for <b title='you'>ya</b>. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't <b title='be able to be present at a particular event'>make it</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What happened?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who cares, AND?<br>
<i>Mike</i>...and I was wondering if, you know, maybe one of you guys-<br>
<i>Ross</i>(stands up) I'll do it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(standing up too) M-Me, me, me!<br>
<i>Mike</i>You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only <b title='opportunity'>room</b> for one.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pick me, I look great in a <b title='tuxedo - a type of jacket that men wear on very formal occasions'>tux</b> and I will not steal focus.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean, watch! (he <b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mime, mimic, mock, simulate'>mimics</b> the groomsmen's way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Uh, you know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... <b title='because'>as</b> he is me!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used for saying that you think sb has said sth silly'>Please</b>, you're <b title='go down - be defeated in a competition'>going down</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You are going downer!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't <b title='succeed in a particular activity'>make it</b>! (they hug)
<s>Wedding rehearsal dinner. Joey and Mike are talking.</s>
<i>Joey</i>So, you know I'm <b title="fill in - do sb's job for them while they are away ↗take over">filling in</b> for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what're your intentions with my Phoebe?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I intend to marry her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, a <b title='sb who annoys you because they think that they know more about a particular thing than anyone else ↗know-at-all, smarty-pants'>wiseacre</b>. (Mike looks <b title='↗confused, puzzled, bemused, perplexed'>bewildered</b>). Now, I-I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?<br>
<i>Mike</i>No more so than acting.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Strike two!<br>
<i>Mike</i>You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!<br>
<i>Mike's mother</i>Michael, can I <b title='have a meeting with'>see</b> you for a moment? <br>
<i>Mike</i>Yeah, sure. (to Joey) This was... weird.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What's with the face?<br>
<i>Joey</i>That Mike has no respect. I'm not sure about him. Wait that's not him, there he is.<br>
(Cut to Chandler and Ross. Phoebe comes out of the ladies room and they run toward her.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, what-what did you decide?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I decided to <b title='=urinate ↗poo, number two'>pee</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen <b title='fall out - leave'>fell out</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sure, just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hahaha. Such <b title='bitter - feeling angry, jealous, and upset because you think you have been treated unfairly'>bitterness</b>. (to Phoebe) Best to keep that attitude <b title='just be a guest'>in the seats</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Come on, Pheebs. We both really wanna do this, and <b title="It's your decision ↗call">it's up to you</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking <b title='past'>by</b>). Oh ok, wait. Rach! Uh Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) <b title='used to say you are happy or excited about sth'>Goody</b>, what is it!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, there's a <b title='a position in a list of things or in a competition'>spot</b> open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What, what, wait, no, I don't, I don't, I don't wanna do that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>All right, I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'll do it! (Monica approaches)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your <b title="an occasion when people all drink together and say sb's name in order to show their admiration or good wishes">toast</b>. (Mike appears)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You had a bathroom <b title='rest'>break</b> at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, <b title='relating to'>in regard</b> to the toast, ok, you wanna keep them short, nothing <b title='kill - make sth stop/fail'>kills</b> a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Ok. You just get in, do your thing and get out!<br>
<i>Mike</i>Is that what you say to Chandler?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(very serious) It's uh 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get <b title='a good/successful beginning'>off to the best start</b>. (she reads a note). Uh, yeah, my, my friend Joey and I, uh. decided to <b title='fix up - arrange for sth to happen =set up'>fix each other up with friends</b> so I, I... (Monica is <b title='twirl - make sth move in circles'>twirling</b> her hands in order to make Phoebe <b title='make sth move or happen faster ≠slow down'>speed up</b> her speech) oh I... hum... I-I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...

Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>And, and, moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's <b title='flip - turn pages'>flipping</b> cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that.. to take that, so... Oh, well, ok, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... Monica I can't do it like this! This is MY wedding! Ok, I don't want, I don't want this (she mimes monica's when she was twirling her hands) or this (she taps her watch) or this (she mimes cut) Ok? I just wanted a simple wedding! Where my <b title='the man whom a woman is going to marry'>fiancé</b> CAN GO TO THE <b title="↗restroom, ladies' room">BATHROOM</b> ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Everyone who worked there did that.<br>

<i>Monica</i>My <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b> is: Uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, well that's ok. I think, I think you and I will do much better if you're just... you know here as a bridesmaid.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here, I give you the headset. Well, I don't really wanna give you the headset. Well I guess if you're <b title='take over - begin to do sth that sb else was doing ↗fill in'>taking over</b>, then you should probably return these messages. (hands her a <b title='pile'>stack</b> of papers with messages and calls to return)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, this is a lot!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know.<br>
(Mike enters the room).<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?<br>
<i>Mike</i>(thinks a moment) Orchids? {I don't think so. orkidéer}<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!<br>
(Joey comes out from his room)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to Mike) Hello Michael.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Joseph.<br>

<i>Mike</i>(looking around the room) This is... this's great.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey <b title='tower - be much taller than the people or things that are near you'>towers</b> over him. He starts talking in an Italian <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfather_Trilogy">Wiki</a>]'>godfather</b>-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... <b title='on the contrary'>instead</b>, you disrespected me...

<i>Mike</i>(not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia">Wiki</a>]'>Mafia</b> movie?<br>

<i>Mike</i>Joey, I <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> have a lot to do today, what-what'd you want?<br>
<i>Joey</i>I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.<br>
<i>Mike</i>(gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I<b title='would'>'d</b> die before I let anything happen to her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's <b title='a group of people who live together and are related to one another'>family</b>, ok? And now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.<br>
<i>Mike</i>That must've been one <b title='of very bad quality ↗crappy'>lousy</b> movie.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? Hey, if you pick Ross, you know he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some <b title='entertainment that is intended to make people laugh'>comedy</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah yeah, I <b title='thought'>figured</b> you might. <b title='Because'>'Cause</b> of the history, and you used to love him... you guys have a baby.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well thank you for respecting my decision.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen.

I mean, this guy would <b title='to not hit the ball in baseball three times'>strike out</b> and then run to <b title='third base'>third</b>.

<i>Phoebe</i>No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I, I gotta go, I have another call, <b title='a title used for some Christian priests and ministers ↗minister, priest, vicar'>Reverend</b>. (switches calls) Hello?<br>
(Mike and Joey come out of Joey's room)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I'm glad we had this little talk.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Yes. Yeah. And thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Bye.<br>
(Mike opens the door and there is a <b title='extremely large'>gigantic</b> ice sculpture standing in the doorway)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Uh, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the <b title='corridor'>hall</b>?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God, what's it doing here?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the <b title='the process of sending bills for payment'>billing</b> address <b title='used to make a contrast between two things'>as opposed to</b> the <b title='the delivery of goods'>shipping</b> address.

<i>Chandler</i>(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='↗hardly, rarely'>barely</b> <b title='contain - control strong feelings'>containing</b> himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You too.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I will.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Me too.<br>
(They walk passed each other, Ross towards the door, Chandler towards the counter, suddenly they turn around to face each other)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an <b title=' stupid/annoying person'>ass</b>, why're you?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not supposed to tell you.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm not supposed to tell YOU!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Did Rachel say you could be in the wedding?<br>
<i>Ross</i>YES!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>She told me that too!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I don't believe this, I played the Emma card!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I looked into my soul!<br>
(Cut to Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Ross storm in looking very unhappy)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, <b title="in sb/sth's defense - sth that you say to support sb/sth that is being criticized">in my defense</b>, you weren't supposed to tell each other!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he <b title='wink - close and open one eye quickly to communicate sth ↗blink'>winks</b> at her and Rachel looks <b title='very annoyed or upset '>disgusted</b>)<br>

(Mike walks in.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Hey, I forgot my scarf.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I-I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.<br>
(All eyes turn to Rachel)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(sarcastic) Wow, this is a <b title='difficult ↗rough'>tough</b> <b title='decision'>one</b>. I think I'm gonna have to <b title='choose, accept'>go with</b> the dog.<br>
(Ross and Chandler look shocked)<br>
(Cut to Phoebe who is in the living room, still on the phone.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Alright, wait, so what you're saying is th-that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the <b title='sb whose job is to serve drinks in a bar'>bartender</b> is not?

<i>Monica</i>(Sounds <b title='move - affect sb emotionally ↗touched'>moved</b>) Really?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Nearly in tears) Please?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You really want me to come back?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>More than I wanna get married.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed <b title='the headset'>you</b> soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.<br>
(Joey walks in)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey, what're you guys gonna do?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(sounds scared already) About what?<br>
<i>Joey</i>The <b title='a storm with a lot of snow and strong winds'>blizzard</b>. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">Wiki</a>]'>New Jersey</b>!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>I know.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic <b title='the place or time where the events in a book, movie etc happen ↗scene'>setting</b>. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Turning to Mike) What'd you think?<br>

<i>Mike's mom</i>No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.<br>
<i>Mike's dad</i>(leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink. (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.<br>
<i>Mike</i>(to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So, <b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>technically</b>, would this person be in the wedding?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I guess.<br>
<i>Chandler and Ross</i>I'll do it!<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you, aren't you scared of dogs?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) He can sense my fear. My throat is <b title='not protected from attack'>exposed</b>.<br>

<i>Monica</i>Really?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to <b title='travel in vehicle'>ride</b> the subway? Uhh-uh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(quickly) I'll do it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'll...<br>

(Cut to inside Central Perk where Rachel is helping Phoebe. Chandler and Monica enter.)<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>I love you guys.<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>I love you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (in her microphone) It's <b title='the time when a military operation or an important event is planned to begin'>zero hour</b>. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's <b title='↗get the show on the road - get sth started. bad boy - thing (generic term) ↗stuff'>get this bad boy on the road</b>.<br>

(She takes off the coat she was wearing over her wedding dress, which is violet and has a darker shade <b title='a piece of clothing like a thin skirt, which is worn under a skirt or dress =slip'>petticoat</b> underneath which shows at one side where the dress is lifted up to about the height of her hip and connected to the petticoat. She's wearing a veil over her curly hair and a <b title="a low-cut dress is shaped so that it shows a woman's neck and the top of her chest">low-cut</b> <b title='a piece of clothing that you wear on the upper half of your body'>top</b> with straps only just hanging over her shoulders.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?<br>

<i>Chandler</i>You look beautiful.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Thank you.<br>
(They start to leave Central Perk. The band starts to play "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here,_There_and_Everywhere">Wiki</a>]'>Here, There and Everywhere</b>" by the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatles">Wiki</a>]'>Beatles</b>. The crowd rises from their seats. Phoebe and Chandler walk down the aisle. Phoebe really <b title='↗radiate'>glows</b> with happiness. So does Mike who watches her walk down the isle. When Phoebe and Chandler arrive, they kiss and Phoebe walks to her bridesmaids.)<br>
<i>Mike</i>My God! Aren't you freezing?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='nah - no ↗nope, not really, no way'>Na-ah</b>.<br>
(The music ends)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this <b title='very enjoyable, holy ↗blissful'>blessed</b> event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike, are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. And may they have many children...who will one day <b title='If you avenge a wrong or harmful act, you hurt or punish the person who is responsible for it ↗revenge'>avenge</b> their family's honor. How could I not get that <b title='role, character'>part</b>? Stupid Ralph Macchio. Right. Ok. Uh, uh, who has the rings?<br>
(One of the groomsmen gives the rings to Joey)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(whispering to Phoebe) Ok.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a-a regular family like everybody else, and-and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)<br>
<i>Mike</i>Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.<br>
<i>Mike</i>I love you too.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh Joey?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chappy's heart rate has slowed <b title='by a large amount, very'>way</b> down.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, ok. Uh uh, Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I do.<br>
(Joey has a "Yeah you do" smile on his face)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok uh, Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?<br>
<i>Mike</i>I do.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I now <b title='officially state'>pronounce</b> you... husband, and wife.<br>
(Phoebe and Mike kiss)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>That really was an <b title='extremely good =unbelievable'>incredible</b> wedding.<br>
<i>Joey</i>It was, yeah. I kinda don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of <b title='a decoration made of flowers that a woman wears on a dress or suit. He thought it is food'>corsage</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I don't know. Maybe he <b title='hook up - start having a sexual relationship with sb'>hooked up</b> with that hot girl he was talking to.<br>
(cut to the street in front of Central Perk where Ross is walking Chappy. He has a plastic bag in his hand.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on Chappy, do your business. <b title='make poop'>MAKE</b>! MA-AKE! I did not <b title='agree to do sth or to take part in sth'>sign on</b> for this.<br>

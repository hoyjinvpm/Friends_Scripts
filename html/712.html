They're looking for a comet on a roof of a New York apartment building. Yeah, that's <b title='sarcastically'>realistic</b>. You <b title='used to say that the effect of an action or situation is the same as if it was another one'>might as well</b> look for the moon on a bright sunny day.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(looking up) Ross, when's this comet thing start?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, <b title='according to the exact details of a rule or law'>technically</b> it started seven billion years ago... (Well, technically you'd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)<br>
<i>All</i>(<b title='groan - make a long low sound, for example because you are in pain or unhappy =moan'>groaning</b>) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok! Ok! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, ok? We'll just watch the pretty light <b title='streak - leave lines or long marks on sth'>streaking</b> across the sky. (Comets don't streak across the sky, <b title='a piece of rock or metal that travels through space ↗meteor show, shooting star, meteorite, asteroid'>meteors</b> do.) Ok? Whose official name is <b title='a fictional comet [<a href="http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-the-bapstein-comet">ChaCha</a>]'>Bapstein-King</b>.<br>
<i>All</i>Oh come on! Are you kidding? (They start to leave again.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok! Ok!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(looking up; gasps) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't <b title='a common personification of nature [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature">Wiki</a>]'>Mother Nature</b> amazing?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(looking up with her) That's a plane!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. No, you can't.<br>
<i>Tag</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh I don't-I don't know.<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title='used as an interjection'>Man</b>, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from the city?) Infinite space. Rreally, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looking through his <b title='a pair of tubes with glass at either end that you look through to see things far away bi- - two, twice, or double↗telescope, monocle'>binoculars</b> at a nearby building) Hey you know what else makes you wonder?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Huh?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Check out the <b title='breasts'>rack</b> on this <b title='a young woman'>chick</b>! You think (looks again) You think those babies are <b title='↗boob job'>real</b>? (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is <b title='glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glaring</b> at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
<s>The Roof, continued from earlier.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting <b title='uncomfortably cold'>chilly</b>. (She walks over to where Chandler is <b title='bundle up - wrap or tie things together'>bundled up</b> in a big coat and <b title='shake slightly =tremble ↗quiver, quake, thrill'>shivering</b>.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(with a quivering voice) No, I'm not!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because it's <b title='making you look more attractive'>flattering</b>! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you know what, I think we're <b title='going to'>gonna</b> <b title='leave'>take off</b> too. We rented a movie.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh! I won't say 'no' to a movie!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh Pheebs, we just actually <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> wanted to be alone.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Shh! Get me out of here.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(whispering) Ross!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come here, <b title='look at this'>check this out</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey's standing.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in <b title='a thick black liquid made from coal, used esp for making the surfaces of roads'>tar</b> right here. (Bends down to get a closer look.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey <b title='come on - expressing disbelief or impatience'>come-</b>I can't believe- I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most <b title='very impressive'>spectacular</b> <b title='sb/sth that is very impressive or surprising'>phenomenon</b>, and all you care about are bugs, stuck in tar and-and <b title='used to mean a person or thing, when you do not know or say exactly which'>some</b> woman!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(standing up) You know, there's two women, <b title='used to address sb'>dude</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Show me where?<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title='exactly'>Right</b>-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(annoyed) I don't know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause) Yeah, I do.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Joey!<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! All right! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_king">Wiki</a>]'>Burger King</b> comet!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's called the Bapstein-King comet, ok? (Joey starts to groan.) Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected <b title='astro- - relating to the stars, the planets, or space ↗astronaut, astronomy'>astronomer</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Monica is sleeping and Chandler's sitting in bed, <b title='completely awake ↗sound asleep'>wide awake</b>.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>(whispering) Monica!<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's sleeping.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was <b title='a 1998 American science fiction disaster film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Impact_(film)">Wiki</a>]'>Deep Impact</b> and which one was <b title='a 1998 American science fiction disaster drama film [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_(1998_film)">Wiki</a>]'>Armageddon</b>?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Deep Impact was the one with <b title='an American actor and director. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall">Wiki</a>]'>Robert Duval</b>, <b title='(in the Bible) a battle between good and evil at the end of the world'>Armageddon</b> is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Sorry, I just... can't sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...(Fake <b title='snore - breathe noisily while you sleep'>snores</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the <b title='the front part of your leg between your knee and your foot ↗calf, thigh'>shin</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and <b title='head - go in particular direction'>heads</b> into the living room.)
<s>Phoebe's apartment, there is a beeping noise coming from the living room and Phoebe sleepily goes to investigate.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='a hand gesture denoting a hope for good luck [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_fingers">Wiki</a>]'>crossing her fingers</b> and closing her eyes) Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that it's the smoke detector that's beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in <b title='an annoyed or impatient feeling that you get when you are prevented from doing what you want'>frustration</b> she <b title='yank - suddenly pull sth quickly and with force'>yanks</b> the thing off of the wall. She <b title='set - put'>sets</b> it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.) How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...<br>
<i>Smoke Detector</i>Beep!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Don't interrupt me!
<s>The Roof, Ross and Joey are banging on the door.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Rachel! Monica!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Come on!<br>
(Ross gets <b title='↗sick of'>fed up with</b> Joey's banging and stops him by pulling him away from the door.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>I can't believe this!<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right well, you know... I guess we know what we have to do is to get down.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross. I was thinking we just go down the fire escape. (<b title='point sth out - tell sb sth that they did not already know '>Points it out</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Joey) I know, I wasn't finished. (Joey <b title='motion - signal by making a gesture (a movement of part of your body)'>motions</b> him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!
<s>Monica and Chandler's kitchen, Chandler has a <b title='↗pitcher'>jug</b> of milk in his hands and decides to make some warm milk. He opens up the cabinet to get a pot and <b title='manage to - succeed in doing sth difficult (humorously/sarcastically in this case)'>manages to</b> knock several other pots onto the floor making a lot of noise.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Shhh! (Monica enters) I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.<br>
<i>Monica</i>With a <b title='a large pan shaped like a bowl, used in Chinese cooking ↗[<a href="http://www.zdic.net/z/26/js/944A.htm">鑊</a>]'>wok</b>? (Chandler's holding a wok.) I thought you were gonna read my boring book to put you to sleep.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It got interesting! Damn you <b title='Oprah&#039;s Book Club was a book discussion club segment of the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah%27s_Book_Club">Wiki</a>] ↗Opera'>Oprah</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Here, let me make the milk, I'm <b title='not in bed ↗sit up, wait up, stay up'>up</b> anyway.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, you know what we could do? You know, <b title='because/as a result of sth'>now that</b> we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, you know like we did when we were first <b title='go out - have a romantic relationship with sb ↗ask out, date'>going out</b>. It'd be fun!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok that does sound fun.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, so how <b title='sad'>bummed</b> were you when the second sister died huh?<br>
<i>Monica</i>The second sister dies?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.<br>
<i>Monica</i>The second sister dies in <b title='an American comic book [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughead%27s_Double_Digest">Wiki</a>]'>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That's correct.
<s>Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Tag are <b title='make out - kiss and touch sb in a sexual way'>making out</b> on the couch.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>You <b title='want to'>wanna</b> go in the bedroom? A little more comfortable.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Sure.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Did, umm, did you send those contracts to <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan">Wiki</a>]'>Milan</b>?<br>
<i>Tag</i>This is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that it's not working.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No seriously, you know the contracts I gave you, did you <b title='keep sth overnight'>overnight</b> them?<br>
<i>Tag</i>What contracts?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't <b title='understand'>get</b>.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Like what?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Come on Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes I did! And I put a little <b title='a piece of paper stationery with a re-adherable strip of adhesive on the back, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note">Wiki</a>]'>Post-it</b> on it that said, "Must go out today," and I underlined today three times and, <b title='used to say what happens next or what you do next'>and then</b> I put a little heart in the corner <b title='because'>'cause</b> I didn't wanna seem to <b title='-y - having a quality, like or typical of'>bossy</b>.<br>
<i>Tag</i><b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, you never gave them to me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.<br>
<i>Tag</i>No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your <b title='the area between your legs where they join your body ↗groin, loins'>crotch</b>!<br>
<i>Tag</i>Do you wanna go down to the office <b title='at the present time/immediately'>right now</b>?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! <b title='exclamation indicating the belief that sth should have been considered obvious to sb else'>Come on</b>, it's late, we're not gonna go down to the office.<br>
<i>Tag</i>Yeah I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldn't wanna be proved wrong either.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel <b title='all of a sudden'>suddenly</b> stops and <b title='stick - put'>sticks</b> the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook <b title='bra ↗lingerie, stocking, knickers, panties'>this</b>? Nice work!

<i>Joey</i>I won't go down any further. It's stuck.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that <b title='a small area of sth that is different from the area around it'>patch</b> of ice, ok? Not hit the <b title='a large metal container used for waste in the US [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster">Wiki</a>]'>Dumpster</b> on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird <b title='-ish - like'>brownish</b> red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there... you go up to the roof and you let me in.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">Wiki</a>]'>bungy jumping</b>. You know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh <b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens'>what if</b> I <b title='hit sth hard and noisily ↗smash, crash'>smack</b> my head on the <b title='a hard substance used in building made by mixing cement, sand, small stones, and water ↗lime'>concrete</b>?<br>

You-you <b title='guess which side of a coin will land upwards ↗heads, tails'>call it</b> in the air, all right?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Aw, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tail! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Well, you be careful.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Ok, look I have an <b title='a short performance by an actor etc that sb watches to judge if they are good enough to act in a play etc'>audition</b> tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I'm not jumping! I have a son! Ok? He won't have a father if-if I die!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well all right, so, it looks like we're <b title='if the score in a game is even, two teams or players have the same number of points ↗tie'>even</b>!
<s>Phoebe's apartment, Phoebe is still investigating the smoke detector trying to figure out how to stop the beeping.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.) Ok so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to <b title='keep hitting sb/sth hard ↗punch, pound, stomp, stamp'>pummel</b> the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her <b title='a walk that seems long and difficult ↗hike'>trek</b> to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the <b title='corridor'>hallway</b> by the now steady and extremely loud tone <b title='emanate - produce/show ↗radiate'>emanating</b> from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Monica is entering with a <b title='a tall cup, usu with straight sides and a handle'>mug</b>.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, here's your milk. What do you wanna talk about? (She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='suddenly frightened or surprised by sth'>startled</b>) What? What? What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ohh! Ohh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here. (Hands the mug of milk to him.)
<s>Phoebe's apartment. The continuous beeping is still driving Phoebe crazy. She decides to put on a winter cap and <b title='a pair of coverings for the ears connected by a band across the top of the head ↗mute, muffle'>earmuffs</b> to stop hearing the beeping.</s>
<i>Phoebe (in her head)</i>Oh! Oh, that's so much better. Ok, well at least I can hear myself think.

Anyway, you know what, the <b title='main idea/meaning'>point</b> is, Tag, start looking because you are gonna find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)<br>
<i>Tag</i>So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-it on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there all right?<br>

<i>Rachel</i><b title='sth that is difficult to understand or explain'>Puzzler</b>. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?<br>

<i>Tag</i>Fine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don't get it.
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, Chandler has his eyes closed, while Monica is fully awake.</s>
<i>Monica</i>You still awake?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah! You?<br>
<i>Monica</i>You <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> know that was me that just said that right? (He doesn't respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. <b title='on the condition that, provided that ↗as far as'>As long as</b> we're both up...<br>

<i>Chandler</i>No. We were in the middle of sex... and you fell asleep.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you <b title='caused me to think about sb/sth in a completely new way'>rocked me world</b>! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)<br>

<i>Tag</i>Do you want me to check again?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well yeah, I wish you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no it's not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn't see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)<br>
<i>Tag</i>Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(thinks) I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check. (As she heads for her office, she stops <b title='glance - quickly look at sb/sth'>glancing</b> over her shoulder at Tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)<br>
<i>Tag</i>(<b title='smirk - smile in a silly or unpleasant way that shows that you are pleased with yourself ↗grin'>smirking</b>) Any luck?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Can I see you in my office for a minute?<br>
<i>Tag</i>(entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them! (Rachel is not amused, because she's still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every 'good' boss.) You know what? I'm not even gonna <b title="show that you are happy about your own success or sb else's failure">gloat</b>. I'm just really <b title='feeling happy because you are no longer worried about sth'>relieved</b> this whole thing is over.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You put these on my desk!<br>
<i>Tag</i>I did not!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh really? So you're saying they just <b title='past tense of "slide"'>slid</b> out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think <b title='a talking dog from the Dilbert comic strip [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogbert">Wiki</a>]'>Dogbert</b> should have a <b title='words that sb has to learn and say as part of a play or performance'>line</b> here.)<br>
<i>Tag</i>How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(pause as she realizes her <b title='not good, poor'>lame</b> attempt to <b title="shift blame/responsibility - make sb/sth else responsible for sth">shift the blame</b> has failed) I am so <b title='feeling sexually excited ↗turn on'>hot</b> for you right now.
<s>Phoebe's apartment, there is someone <b title='pound - hit'>pounding</b> on the door and Phoebe sleepily walks over and answers it. As she nears the door, the pounding stops and she can hear the smoke detector's <b title='make a long high sound ↗cry, weep, whine, siren'>wail</b>.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh my God! How did you get back here?!<br>
<i>A <b title='seeming not to have a body or not to be connected to a body'>Disembodied</b> Voice</i>(yelling through the door) Phoebe Buffay?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(<b title='↗terrified, horrified, frightened'>scared</b>) Fire Alarm? (She opens the door to <b title='show sth that previously could not be seen'>reveal</b> a <b title='fire fighter, fire truck/engine'>fireman</b> holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer fireman, can-can I help you?<br>
<i>The Fireman</i>We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uhm, that's not mine.<br>
<i>The Fireman</i>Yes it is.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>How do you know?<br>
<i>The Fireman</i>The next time you wanna <b title='get rid of'>dump</b> a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok do you-Ok, do you have a <b title='a legal document that gives the police official permission to search a building [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant">Wiki</a>] ↗void'>search warrant</b>? Because the last time I checked this was still America!<br>
<i>The Fireman</i>Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God tell me how to stop them from <b title='if an alarm goes off, it makes a noise'>going off</b>!<br>
<i>The Fireman</i>Just press the reset button under the plastic cover.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and she goes to shut it off.) There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button, where is- there's a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh, God! (To the fire alarm) Fine! You live here. The rent's <b title='if an amount of money is due, it must be paid at a particular time'>due</b> on the 15th!
<s>The fire escape, Joey is now hanging off of the bottom <b title='one of the bars that form the steps of a ladder ↗handrail, banister, railing'>rung</b> of the ladder that won't move and Ross is watching from above.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, you-you have a good <b title='↗grasp, clutch'>grip</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, I'm gonna start to climb down you now.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right! Just hurry up!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're <b title='↗arse, ass, buttock, bottom, posterior, rear, stern, tush, tushie, tushy'>butt</b> to face.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I think face to face.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I would say that.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Face to face, yeah!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, here I go.<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right.<br>
(Ross steps onto the bottom rung of the ladder and then steps on Joey's chest.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='grunt - make a short low sound in the throat'>grunting</b>) Oh <b title='used an interjection'>my</b>... How much do you weigh Ross?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little <b title='[<a href="http://www.gjsentinel.com/breaking/articles/holiday_food_doesnt_have_to_me">Holiday food does&#039;nt have to mean holiday weight gain</a>]'>holiday weight</b>.<br>
(Ross continues to climb down. He puts his other foot further down on Joey's <b title='the upper part of your body, not including your head or arms ↗trunk, bust'>torso</b>, but that doesn't work very well and he's forced to wrap his legs around Joey. Which then forces Joey to get a nice and close view of Ross's crotch.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it <b title='as much as possible, completely'>all the way</b> through.<br>
<i>Ross</i>So what do you want me to do?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well, just <b title='move forwards or backwards while also quickly moving slightly from side to side'>shimmy</b> down me and <b title='let yourself fall'>drop</b>!<br>
(Ross continues his trek <b title='↗up, north, down'>south</b>, and when they get face to face.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hi.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(looking down) You know, M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's still pretty far!<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's not that far! Just drop!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do not <b title='make sb hurry ↗push, urge'>rush</b> me!<br>
(Ross continues south and his now wrapped around Joey's legs.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross, you should know that my pants are starting to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!<br>
(Ross <b title='panic - have a sudden strong feeling of fear or worry and be unable to think clearly or calmly'>panics</b> and falls off, dropping to the ground with a huge crash.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oww! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I <b title='↗sprain, wrench'>twisted</b> it when I-Ooh, a <b title='↗nickel, dime'>quarter</b>!
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, they're <b title='cuddle - hold sb/sth close in your arms to show love or affection ↗hug, embrace, snuggle, huddle'>cuddling</b>.</s>
<i>Monica</i>That really was some of your best work.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can't believe that I've only got two hours until I <b title='phone to say you are not coming to work because you are ill'>call in sick</b> for work.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I have to be up in seven minutes.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You wanna?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! You get the <b title='an electrical machine that cleans floors, carpets etc by sucking up dirt and dust'>vacuum cleaner</b> and I'll get the furniture <b title='a chemical substance that you rub onto an object to make it shine'>polish</b>!<br>
(She runs off leaving a <b title='very surprised or shocked'>stunned</b> Chandler behind.)<br>

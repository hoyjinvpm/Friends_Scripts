<i>Ross</i>Dad, come on, kids.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>Right. Look, your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.<br>
<i>Mr. Geller</i>'Cause there's time to <b title='make a bad situation better'>make up for</b> that. We can do stuff together.

<s>Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is <b title="neglect - pay too little attention to sth">neglecting</b> the game of Scrabble, for he's busily <b title='draw on - use information, experience, knowledge etc for a particular purpose'>drawing on</b> his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross.

<i>Chandler</i>Ok, <b title='↗possible/likely/nightmare scenario'>worst-case scenario</b>. <b title='imagine sth happening'>Say</b> you never feel like a father.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you have a <b title="a single fact, idea, or opinion that is part of an argument">point</b>?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, you think I would.<br>
(Instead of <b title="scramper - run with quick short steps, like a child or small animal">scampering</b>, Marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i><b title="Is there anything new/wrong">What's up</b> with the <b title="similar/relating to a monkey ↗ape, gorilla, guerrilla, chimpanzee">simian</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>It's just a fur ball.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right. (returning to the board) Ok, whose turn is it?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?<br>
(The unvoiced <b title="hiss - make a noise which sounds like 'ssss'">hissing</b> continues. In alarm, Ross and Chandler look at the monkey, who is now in some <b title="a state of extreme sorrow, suffering, or pain ↗agony">distress</b>.)
<s>The Emergency Room, Monica sits with Rachel, who is filling out an honest form at last. Ross and Chandler <b title="move or fall very fast">hurtle</b> in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a <b title='very soft'>fluffy</b> towel, is <b title='↗cuddle'>cradled</b> in Ross's arms. They <b title='run quickly'>dash</b> up to the admissions desk. Ross is <b title='↗hysterical'>frantic</b>.</s>
<i>Ross</i>You've got to help me, my monkey swallowed a 'K'!<br>
(Hearing her brother's voice, Monica gets up to stand behind Chandler, followed by Rachel.)<br>
<i>Nurse</i>(angrily) You had to get that animal <b title='out of'>outta</b> here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No no, you don't understand the animal hospital is <b title='very far'>way</b> across town he's <b title="choke - be unable to breathe properly because sth is in your throat or there is not enough air ↗gag">choking</b> I don't know what else to do.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What's going on?<br>
(Ross and Chandler turn at the voice...)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Marcel swallowed a Scrabble <b title="a flat piece of sth ↗[<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong'>Mahjong</a>] (144 tiles)">tile</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh.<br>
(..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and Ross and Chandler <b title="move quickly and violently">whip around</b> once more. Monica and Rachel <b title="move back suddenly ↗flinch">recoil</b> slightly.)<br>
<i>Nurse</i>Excuse me... This hospital is for people!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches <b title="an American television quiz show [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy'>Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-Jeopardy!_set_evolution_(daily_syndication)-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Jeopardy%21_set_evolution_%28daily_syndication%29.jpg/250px-Jeopardy%21_set_evolution_%28daily_syndication%29.jpg">">Jeopardy!</b> He he <b title="masturbate - rub your sexual organs in order to get sexual pleasure">touches himself</b> when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!<br>
(Ross's <b title="using a lot of energy and strength or determination">vigorous</b> protest is attracting attention.)<br>
<i>Dr. Mitchell</i>I'll take a look at him.<br>
(Rachel, Monica, Ross and Chandler whip around for a second time, <b title="If people or things are in formation, they are arranged in a particular pattern as they move">in formation</b>.)<br>
<i>Rachel and Monica</i>Oh, thank you.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Michael.<br>
<i>Dr. Mitchell</i>Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(as Rachel) Monica.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(as Monica) Oh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(as Rachel) Hi.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(as Monica) Hi.<br>
(Monica smiles to cover her embarrassment, but Rachel sadly looks away...)
<s>Central Perk, Joey is playing "<b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Loves_Me..._He_Loves_Me_Not">Wiki</a>]'>She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not</b>" with the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she <b title='smooth out - make sth such as paper or cloth flat by moving your hands across it ↗crease, crumple'>smooths out</b> the identifying <b title="a piece of clothing ↗outfit">garment</b>, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) Hey.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Urse...<br>
(Phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) Listen, um...<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't <b title='understand'>get</b> it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?<br>
(Phoebe is almost <b title="make sb feel very confused">thrown</b> by this.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talking crazy that night, I was so <b title='↗wasted, hammered, sober'>drunk</b>!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You don't drink.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she <b title='↗defend from, fight off'>fends him off</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) If it was, would you stop <b title="hang out - hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing">hanging out</b> with her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Thinking carefully) No. No, I, I couldn't do that.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Then, uh, then I'm sorry.<br>
(He sinks to the sofa, <b title='-en - make sth have a particular quality ↗darken, brighten, weaken, strengthen'>saddened</b> by Ursula's <b title="a warning to sb that unless they act in a particular way, action will be taken against them 哀的美敦书">ultimatum</b>, while Phoebe follows, touched by Joey's good heart.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to <b title='get over sb - start to forget sb and feel happy again after a relationship has ended'>get over</b>.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I know...<br>
(He looks up at her face and Phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. Joey's voice becomes soft and warm.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breaking up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really?<br>
(Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts "Oh, whoa!!" to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her <b title="if a part of your body tingles, it stings slightly, for example because it is very cold or hot">tingling</b> lips. A <b title="thinking seriously about sth">thoughtful</b> Joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, <b title="cock - lift a part of your body, or hold a part of your body at an angle ↗tilt">cocking</b> his head from side to side to <b title='think about sb/sth in a particular way'>regard</b> her <b title="a side view of sb's head">profile</b> from various angles, then...)<br>

<i>Ross</i>He looks so tiny.<br>
(The door <b title='↗storm off'>bursts open</b>, and Joey and Phoebe <b title='↗dash in'>rush in</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>We just got the message.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Is he alright?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY .'<br>
(Ross does not approve of Chandler's <b title="silly">daft</b> theory.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, why?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey, come on, you <b title="to come through a dangerous or difficult situation means to survive it and recover from it">came through</b>, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.<br>
(Ross does approve of this, but he's still not sure. The tiny <b title='↗shape'>figure</b> <b title="stir - move slightly">stirs</b>.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, look, he's waking up!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Quietly) Hey, <b title="a man ↗pal, gal">fella</b>! How you doing?<br>
(All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad.)

<s>Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.</s>
<i>Ross</i>I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you got a girlfriend?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Is this about Mark?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Shocked) Oh my God.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, it's not, it's not.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same <b title='↗quarrel, argument'>fight</b> with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should just take a break.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a <b title='stop for a short time in order to have a rest or eat sth'>break</b>, (Goes to the door) Let's get some <b title=' a frozen dessert made with yogurt and sometimes other dairy products.

<i>Rachel</i>No. A <b title='end a relationship ↗dump'>break</b> from us.<br>

<s>Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't <b title='want to'>wanna</b> take a break.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(on the phone) I've been thinking, this is <b title='not sensible'>crazy</b>, I mean don't, don't you think we can <b title='deal with a problem in a satisfactory way'>work on</b> this?<br>
<i>Mark</i>Hey, what do you want to drink?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Who's that?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Nobody.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Is that Mark?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey look, he just...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah! <b title='I understand'>Got it</b>! (Slams down the phone)

THE NEXT MORNING

<i>Monica</i>How's the big <b title='the day on which an important event happened in a previous year'>anniversary</b> dinner?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, we never actually <b title='get to - arrive/reach'>got to</b> dinner.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='She thought they never left the bedroom'>Ohhh, nice</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, we <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> broke up instead.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Looking up at the ceiling) My God, Monica it's on the ceiling.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's ok, this is more important than fruit (Pause) (Angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, but it's ok, because when Ross left, Mark <b title='come over - visit sb in the place where they are ↗come by, drop by, stop by'>came over</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh no!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rachel, you and Mark?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, no-no, it's ok, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realized how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really wanna make it work.
<s>Ross's Bedroom, Ross is waking up. He straightens himself out on the bed and puts the <b title='↗comforter, quilt, duvet, bedclothes'>covers</b> over his head.</s>
<i>Chloe</i>(Entering from bathroom) Morning!<br>

<i>Ross</i>Ok. (Ross starts <b title='↗hysterical'>frantically</b> looking for a clock.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Bye.<br>
(Ross finds a clock, sees it's almost 8:30, and silently <b title='↗shriek, screech, squeak, squeal'>screams</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Chloe, Chloe how's it <b title='come - happen ↗go'>coming</b>?<br>

<i>Ross</i>Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well... (Picks up her coat)<br>
<i>Chloe</i>Good luck, with your girlfriend.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (Opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Hey!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, there's banana on it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian woman living in mine.<br>
<i>Monica</i>So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, good. Thanks.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='used at the beginning of a sentence when asking for information'>Now</b> what is Fabutech?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, all right don't <b title='criticize'>judge</b> me too much. Ok? Um, but I saw this <b title='a television commercials which generally include a phone number or website [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infomercial">Wiki</a>]'>infomercial</b>, and um, I swear to you I have <b title='used for emphasizing never very strongly'>never ever</b> bought anything on TV before, except for this mop.

<i>Phoebe</i>They have the best stuff in there.
<s>Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God! Oh my God!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah. We <b title='thought ↗reckon'>figured</b> when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to <b title='become friendly with sb again after you have had an argument'>make up with</b> Rachel. Which is probably what you should've done. Huh?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's <b title='completely, totally'>all</b> like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, before we answer that, I think we should <b title='if you address a problem, you start trying to solve it'>address</b> the more important question. How <b title='stupid'>dumb</b> are you?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right? What do I, how am I supposed to do that without being totally honest with each other?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ross look, I'm <b title='take sth on board - listen to and accept a suggestion, idea etc'>on board</b> about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>He's right. Nobody's gonna <b title='get help or an advantage from sth'>benefit</b>, and you're just gonna hurt her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, but don't you think....<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right, look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, ok. (He <b title='plop - sit down or land heavily or without taking care'>plops</b> down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>All right, ok, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. (Spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the <b title='path'>trail</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>What trail?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='stomp - stamp (put a foot down on the ground hard and quickly)'>Stomps</b> on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out you did it! (Slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, ok-ok, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that massage place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
<s>Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and <b title='Linen is labor-intensive to manufacture, but when it is made into garments, it is valued for its exceptional coolness and freshness in hot weather. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen">Wiki</a>]'>linen</b> strips to leg number one,<br>
<i>Monica</i>Did that!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok. Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab <b title='small piece of paper/plastic etc'>tab</b>' and pull it off in one quick pain-free motion.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Was it not pain-free?<br>
<i>Monica</i>No. It was painful. Oh my God, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Huh, well, the girls in the <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin">Wiki</a>] ↗silkworm'>satin</b> <b title='nightie - nightdress'>nighties</b> on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's because their nerves are probably <b title='deaden - make a feeling or a pain less strong. -en - make sth have a particular quality ↗weaken, strengthen'>deadened</b> from being so stupid. But hey, you know, if you don't believe me, please, <b title='sth you say when you give sb permission to do or use sth'>be my guest</b>.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Now, are you glad we didn't start with <b title='↗pubic (connected with the area around the sexual organs) hair, public, private'>the bikini strips</b>?

<i>Ross</i>You took my watch?<br>
<i>Chloe</i>I'm sorry, I do that.<br>

<i>Chloe</i>Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's <b title='matter'>business</b>, you know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?<br>
<i>Chloe</i>Oh, I tell Issac everything.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You thief, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! You know we haven't actually met...<br>
<i>Issac</i>You <b title="sometimes said admiringly, in particular regarding a man's sexual exploits">dog</b>!<br>

<i>Issac</i>Oh right, that Rachel <b title='a young woman ↗chica'>chick</b> from the coffee place.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't wanna hurt her.<br>

<i>Issac</i>Aw, no problem <b title='used to address sb ↗man, pal, buddy'>dude</b>. You know we gotta <b title='take care of'>look out for</b> each other. We're the same, you and me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Actually, no, we're not.<br>
<i>Issac</i>Yeah, we are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, we're not.<br>
<i>Issac</i>Yeah, we are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>No, we're not!!<br>
<i>Issac</i>Ok, we're not.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Right.<br>
<i>Issac</i>But we are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.<br>
<i>Issac</i>I can promise not to tell her again.
<s>Phoebe's Work, Ross is now trying to stop Jasmine from telling Phoebe.</s>
<i>Ross</i>(Entering out of breath) Jasmine?<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah, we met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>You did a bad thing!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yes, I did.<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>Very bad!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Very bad.<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>Very, very bad.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you <b title='↗by chance'>happen to</b> tell Phoebe yet?<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>No.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just <b title='work out - solve a problem'>work it out</b> with her. Ok?<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>All right.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Thank you, thank you.<br>
<i>Jasmine</i>But you should probably talk to my <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b>, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.<br>

(Ross turns around and sees Rachel sitting <b title='near'>by</b> the window. She is just glaring at him.)
<s>Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe still have wax strips on their legs.</s>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, I get an idea. Why don't you pull off mine, and I pull off yours?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Or, you pull off yours, and I will leave mine on...because I think I can make this look work.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come on, Phoebe. We can do this.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower <b title='a high/low pain/boredom etc threshold - the ability or inability to suffer a lot of pain or boredom before you react to it'>threshold of pain</b> than men, that's all. I mean, <b title='expressing disbelief or impatience'>come on</b>, it's just a little wax.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Oh, that's mature.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's right.<br>
(Joey laughs, pulls it off, then does a high-pitched <b title='an unpleasant high sound or voice'>whine</b>. He looks at Chandler and does the whine again.)<br>

<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, never <b title='be unfaithful to ↗run/walk out on'>cheat on</b> Rachel.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can't answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there when I was in there?!<br>
(Ross hands Rachel back the newspaper, and she starts beating him with it again.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh! Yes you did!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing is that she meant, she meant nothing to me!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>And yet she was worth <b title='jeopardize - threaten, endanger'>jeopardizing</b> our relationship!!<br>
(She throws the paper at him, misses and hits Monica's door, they all <b title='↗retreat, grimace, wince'>jump back</b> at the sound.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardize. I thought we were broken up.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We were on a <b title='stop/rest'>break</b>!<br>
<i>Ross</i>That for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a <b title='end of relationship'>break-up</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You think you're gonna get out of this on a <b title='small details ↗technical'>technicality</b>?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, ok? I thought our relationship was dead!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Why not?! (to Chandler) I'm hungry.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Because they'll know we've been listening.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, that is so <b title='kind, gentle, pleasing ↗sarcastic'>sweet</b>. I think I'm falling in love with you <b title='If you do sth all over again, you start again from the beginning'>all over again</b>.<br>
[Cut to Monica's bedroom]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, we'll be fine.<br>
[Cut to Living Room]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey <b title='convince - persuade sb to do sth'>convinced</b> me not to.<br>
[Cut to Monica's bedroom]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(Handing Monica the wax) <b title='put wax on ↗seal, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_%28film%29"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/The_Rock_%28movie%29.jpg/220px-The_Rock_%28movie%29.jpg"></a>'>Wax</b> the door shut, we're never leaving, <b title='Never ever is an emphatic way of saying "never"'>ever</b>.<br>
[Later, Phoebe is on the phone, they're all still trapped in Monica's bedroom.]<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there. No I'm-I'm in the middle of a huge relationship fight, so... (Listens) Oh no that's all right, it's not mine.<br>
[Cut to Living Room]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Don't you realize none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right. Let's <b title='think that sth is true ↗suppose, presume, assume'>say</b> I had slept with Mark. Would you've been able to forgive me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Pause) Yes I would.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You'd be ok if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Less sure) Yes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You knew that our hot, <b title='covered in sweat. -y - full of/covered with sth'>sweaty</b>, <b title='writhe - move by twisting and turning ↗squirm, wriggle'>writhing</b> bodies were....<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Ok, ok, yeah, I would've been <b title='feeling very shocked and upset ↗ravage, wreck'>devastated</b> but, I would still wanna be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.<br>
[Cut to Monica's bedroom]<br>
<i>All</i>Ohhhhh!<br>
[Later, Ross and Rachel are sitting in the kitchen.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-Pizza_med_gorgonzola,_spinat_og_bacon,_March_2010-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Pizza_med_gorgonzola%2C_spinat_og_bacon%2C_March_2010.jpg/250px-Pizza_med_gorgonzola%2C_spinat_og_bacon%2C_March_2010.jpg"> ↗[<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_tower  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_tower%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_tower">Leaning Tower of Pisa</a>]'>pizza</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'<br>
(She turns around and glares at him, he turns away.)<br>
[Cut to Monica's bedroom]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh <b title='used as an exclamation'>man</b>, pizza? I like pizza. (Makes like he is trying to send a <b title='a telepathic message is sent from one person to another by using thoughts, not by talking or writing ↗[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_%28novel%29">The Shining</a>] ↗thought control'>telepathic</b> message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>We could eat the wax! It's organic.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh great, food with hair on it.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, not the used wax.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Because that would be crazy?<br>
[Cut to Living Room]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, can I, can I <b title='become involved in'>get in on</b> that? 'Cause I'm kinda hungry myself.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>With ah, extra anchovies.<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's ok, I'll just pick <b title='them'>'em</b> off.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?<br>
[Cut to later, they are finishing up the pizza, there's one piece left.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>You can have the last piece, if you want.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.<br>
[Cut to Monica's bedroom, they're all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe, don't like it. Joey tries some and <b title='make a face - put an expression on'>makes a face</b> like 'Hey, that's not so bad.']<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They're gonna <b title='manage to deal with a difficult situation'>get through</b> this, aren't they?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got to.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='used to ask what you should do or what the result will be if sth happens, esp sth bad'>What if</b> they don't?<br>
(Long pause.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>You think I need a new walk?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Well you know, I've been walking the same way since high school. You know, you know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' <b title='the way sb walks'>walk</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Are you actually saying these words?<br>
[Later, in the living room, Rachel is sitting on the couch, Ross is on the chair.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>What, now you're not even taking to me? (Moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat, right? I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!<br>
[Cut to Monica's bedroom]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a '<b title='exclamation indicating the belief that sth should have been considered obvious to sb else'>come on</b>' look.) Yeah, ok.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice that neither one of them are wondering where I am.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, you know, people can be so self-involved.<br>
[Cut to Living Room]<br>
<i>Ross</i>You know what, you know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, ok. You're the one that <b title='bail - give up/abandon/escape'>bailed</b> on us. You're the one that, that ran the moment things got just a little <b title='difficult'>rough</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That's...<br>
<i>Ross</i>That's what?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>That is <b title='not important'>neither here nor there</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you wanna do? How do you wanna handle it? Huh? You wanna fight for us? Or do you wanna bail? (Sits down next to her) Look, I, (<b title='at the point where sth is about to happen'>on the verge of</b> tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Ok? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so <b title='used for emphasis ↗darn'>damn</b> good. Rachel, I love you so much.<br>
(He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just before he kisses her on the lips...)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Ross!! (Stands up and moves away from him) Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, ok? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't <b title='used for emphasis'>just</b> make it better. Ok?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Softly) I think you should go.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Softly) I really think you need to go now.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Moving over to stand in front of her) Ok, ok. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, what the hell did I know?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Ok? (Takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can't <b title='↗picture'>imagine</b>, I can't imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) You know? Without, without these arms, and your face, and <b title='↗cardiac, cerebral'>heart</b>. Your good heart Rach, (Drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Crying) No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop <b title='picture - imagine'>picturing</b> with her, I can't, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed everything. Forever.<br>
[We see the rest of them are now crying.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>(Crying) Yeah, let it come, this can't be it, I mean.<br>
(Pause)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Then <b title='why'>how come</b> it is?
<s>Monica's bedroom.</s>
<i>Phoebe</i>They've been quiet for a long time.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Maybe she killed him.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Let's go.<br>
[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is sleeping on the couch, Ross is gone, the rest of them can finally emerge from their <b title='a small room in a prison or police station ↗cubicle, cubical, cubic'>cell</b>. They all wave goodbye, and start to walk quietly out, as Monica goes and puts a blanket on Rachel. Joey starts walking all <b title='hunch - bend down and forwards so that your back forms a curve'>hunched</b> over and <b title='bob - move up and down with short regular movements ↗bumpy, heaving beast'>bobbing</b> his shoulders as he goes.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(to Joey) Is that your new walk?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(Whispering) No, I really have to <b title='↗urinate, bladder, kidney, urine, urinal, poo'>pee</b>.<br>

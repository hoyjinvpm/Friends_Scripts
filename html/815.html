<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. Except Ross is more <b title='≠relaxed ↗casual, breezy'>uptight</b> about <b title='crumb - a very small piece of dry food ↗crumble, crumple'>crumbs</b> than you are.<br>
<i>Ross</i>There was a <b title='the lower part of the leg of a chicken'>drumstick</b> in the couch.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And I am not uptight about crumbs. It's just that, you know, crumbs attract mice and mice leave <b title='the solid waste of animals or birds ↗excrement, feces, faeces, crap, dung, shit, manure, dropping'>droppings</b> and that's how the <b title='a disease that causes death and spreads quickly to a large number of people ↗contagious, infectious, pandemic'>plague</b> started.

<i>Ross</i>Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her <b title='immediately/at the present time'>right now</b>. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'<br>

<i>Ross</i>All right. (reading the label) 'Candy and Cookie?'<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's name is also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, come here. I wanna show you something in the bathroom.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, Monica, grow up!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, what you got behind your back?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Nothing. Just something I wanna get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.<br>

<i>Joey</i>No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>He-hee!<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you <b title='have got to'>gotta</b> admit, looks a lot like Jane.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. So, you can keep him till he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up! I borrowed him myself <b title='sometimes, not often ↗once in a while, every now and then, at times'>from time to time</b> when I get really depressed thinking about you know, world hunger, <b title='state of being poor ↗wealth'>poverty</b>... not-not to <b title='make sth seem less important'>trivialise</b> your pain.<br>

<i>Joey</i>Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesn't, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!<br>
(The dog returns with a ball that looks exactly like the same one Joey has.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hi.<br>

I always- I'm talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it. (exits)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(to the dog) Come here. Hey. Hey. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. <b title='used to say that the effect of an action is the same as if it was another one'>Might as well</b> be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her.

<i>Monica</i>Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, if you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day...

<i>Monica</i>Chandler, we can't let this tape <b title='spoil, damage, destroy'>wreck</b> Valentine's Day! I mean you gotta <b title='↗get over - begin to feel better after an upsetting experience'>get past</b> it. Just get back on the horse.

<i>Monica</i>Child-birth, it's-it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.<br>

<i>Ross</i>(not amused) Huh...uh-huh.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?<br>
<i>Mona</i>No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we-we gotta have some boundaries, so, so why don't you just go back to your place and-and give us some privacy?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(as Ross enters with a present) But, Mona, I-I live here.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine's Day! ...Or, something to remember me by.
<s>Monica and Chandler's. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch still staring at the screen.</s>
<i>Monica</i>How long has it been this time?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>90 seconds.<br>
<i>Monica</i>That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>You know, it <b title='haunt - cause problems for sb over a long period of time ↗ghost'>haunts</b> me? <b title="'til = till, until ↗so far">Up 'til now</b>, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila">Wiki</a>]'>tequila</b> <b title='shot - a small glass of strong alcoholic drink'>shots</b> off the naked <b title='↗maid, butler'>houseboy</b>. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we just get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I can do that.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok.<br>
(Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok. Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.<br>
(Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they can't do it and <b title='move backwards ↗reverse, retreat, recoil'>back up</b>. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone knocks on the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, thank God!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, I know!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Come in!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(entering) Hi! I'm so sorry to <b title='rudely interrupt sb'>barge in</b> on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is <b title='dump - end relationship ↗break up'>dumping</b> Ross.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, my God.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Poor Ross.<br>
(Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the action in Ross' apartment)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, great. We have to watch him do <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga">Wiki</a>]'>yoga</b> in his underwear, but for this he closes the <b title='curtains made of heavy cloth'>drapes</b>!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don't watch it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Why? You saw it? Is it scary?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, let's just say it's ironic how <b title='footage of a particular event is a film, or a part of a film, which shows it'>footage</b> of someone being born, can make you want to kill yourself.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Honey, uh, she may not have to watch it, but she's going to have to do it.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, well now, wait. Now I'm all <b title='freak out - make sb very anxious, upset or afraid ↗scare, frighten, horrify, terrify'>freaked out</b>. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.<br>
<i>Monica</i>No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, come on you wanna have kids.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I do! but, the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Asian_Openbill_%28Anastomus_oscitans%29_in_Kolkata_I_IMG_0495.jpg/220px-Asian_Openbill_%28Anastomus_oscitans%29_in_Kolkata_I_IMG_0495.jpg"> <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101019085956AA451fO">Where/when did the "stork bringing babies" story start?</a>'>stork</b> is gonna bring mine.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on, be seriously, you guys, you're not gonna make me watch this alone?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, sure, but you leave a <b title='the lower part of the leg of a chicken'>drumstick</b> under there and you're a bad <b title='↗classmate, playmate, teammate'>roommate</b>.<br>
(Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, <b title='used to show that one is about to do sth, esp sth new, exciting or risky'>here we go</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok. (watching the tape) Ooh, <b title='used as an exclamation'>my</b>! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby <b title='torture - deliberately hurt sb in order to force them to give you information, to punish them, or to be cruel ↗inflict, interrogate'>torturing</b> that woman?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Why have I seen this thing three times?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's...still beautiful.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh! It's horrible!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know! I know, I'm so <b title='feeling sympathy/pity'>sorry</b> for you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God! (Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes) What do I do, I don't wanna do this, how do I get out of it?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No no no, wait, you guy-you guys, look!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What? What? Did her ass explode?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No, the baby's out! Look, look!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>And look how happy the mom is now!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh...Rach!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, <b title='fuck'>screw</b> you guys, you don't have to do it!
<s>Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee as Joey comes from some back area of Central Perk around the corner.</s>
<i>Joey</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, Wh-uh-<br>
<i>Joey</i><b title="'Hello'; 'How are you?'; 'Is there anything new/wrong?'; 'What happened?'">What's up?</b><br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh...Mona just dumped me.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, <b title='used to address sb'>man</b>, I'm sorry. Why?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I mean, I-I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. <b title='after that'>Then</b> I-I uh, I gave her a key to my apartment, <b title='after that'>and then</b> had the locks changed! Then I lied to her, about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I-I actually <b title='criticize'>judge</b> her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Still, that really <b title='suck - used when you dislike sth very much or think sth is very bad'>sucks</b>, man. <b title='used for emphasis'>Just</b> on Valentine's Day.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah. Wait a minute. What-what're you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a <b title='romatic meeting'>date</b> on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sort of. Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Really?!<br>
<i>Joey</i>You don't have to seem so happy about it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, sorry. Well, uh look, maybe, maybe I can help.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I...I d-<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey-hey, whatever it is, I am sure it<b title='has'>'s</b> happened to me. You-you know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.<br>
(Two girls sitting at a table next to them look up in <b title='a strong feeling of dislike, annoyance, or disapproval'>disgust</b>, and Ross and Joey move away)<br>
<i>Ross</i>So anyway, uh, so wh-what is it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Forget about it. No big deal.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come on! Joey! What is it?<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's nothing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Ok, uh...sit down. (they do) Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.<br>
<i>Ross</i>She's not a Tribbiani?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No!<br>
<i>Ross</i>So, uh, so was she, uh, someone from work?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well, uh, does she like you?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why not?<br>
<i>Joey</i>It's complicated. Um, she's with this other guy, for a long time. Someone from work, too. And, I could never do that to the guy, you know? <b title='because'>'cause</b> we're really good friends.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Well I-I thought you hated everyone at work.<br>
<i>Joey</i>No, no, I-I only say that.... so that uh, Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, uh, <b title="used to show that you want sb to repeat what they have just said ↗what, pardon, I'm sorry">excuse me</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Sorry, sorry, and I'm your only friend too.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. So, uh, this-this guy, she used to <b title='have a romantic relationship with'>go out with</b>, is, uh... is he still in love with her?<br>
<i>Joey</i>No. I don't think so.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Um... is he a good guy?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, he's the best.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Oh, I-I don't know.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey Joey, come on, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, Joey, you know what? You-you have to <b title='make the maximum effort to achieve a particular goal'>go for it</b>. How often does this happen to you, huh?

<i>Rachel</i>(thinking) You're gonna have a baby, and you need to be prepared. And you're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the <b title='Video Cassette Recorder [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vcr">Wiki</a>]'>VCR</b>)<br>
<i>Woman on TV</i>I came to the big city to become a star! I'll do...anything to make that happen!<br>
<i>Man on TV</i>Anything?<br>
(Music starts playing...yes...you know what kind of music...)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(thinking) Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant. I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father? No, no, can't get pregnant that way.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>(To Jo Lynn) All right. (Jo Lynn storms off.) (To Monica) Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I <b title='leave the place you work at the end of the day'>get off</b> from the restaurant. You go to the game, then we won't have a night together for another week.<br>

<i>Chandler</i>I-I know. You're right. I wanna see you too. I've just got to <b title='think carefully about how you are going to do sth and plan a good way of doing it'>figure out</b> a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have together is, is precious.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah, ah, ah... I'll think of something.

<i>Ross</i>Oh right, right. (They pause and exchange a <b title='quick look ↗glimpse'>glance</b>. Then, Ross looks away.) So, are you... ah... you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are gonna have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Phoebe's Mike?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I didn't know that you guys <b title='hang out - hang out - spend time with sb somewhere, usu relaxing'>hung out</b>.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We don't. But I thought it would be nice to <b title='gradually begin to know'>get to know</b> him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Shouldn't the pizza be here <b title='at the present time ↗right now'>by now</b>? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?<br>
<i>Mike</i>(looking at his watch) Eleven minutes. (long pause) And now twelve. So, you wanna watch TV or?<br>
<i>Ross</i>You think I haven't thought of that? I mean I-I would like to, but the cable is <b title='not working ↗broken'>out</b>. Didn't seem like such a big deal until tonight.<br>
<i>Mike</i>So you like the beer?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I do. I do. Although, it's actually a <b title='a type of light beer [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager">Wiki</a>]'>lager</b>.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh, God. It seems like <b title='a very long time'>forever</b> ago.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I know. (sighs) So, what's going on with you and Ross?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, um... I don't know. I mean, for a long time, nothing.

<i>Waiter</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Phobe</i>Hey, Rach, maybe there's a less disgusting way to <b title='say "no" politely ↗reject, turn down'>decline</b> a drink. Wow, should we send them something back? Oh, let's! Let's send them <b title='potatoes that have been boiled and crushed until they are smooth ↗smash'>mashed potatoes</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's gonna make them think they can come over here.<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b... baby and a Ross.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."

(Monica <b title='tip - lean, tilt'>tips</b> her head slightly <b title='in such a way that sth seems to be true'>as if</b> asking "Did you hear yourself?") I heard it.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>All right. I got a plan. I'll go down the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cincinnati-fire-escapes.jpg/250px-Cincinnati-fire-escapes.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_escape">Wiki</a>]'>fire escape</b>.<br>

<i>Chandler</i><b title='hear sb out - let sb finish what they are saying without interrupting'>Hear me out</b>, woman! I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Aren't you afraid that Joey's gonna <b title='figure out - be able to understand sth'>figure all of this out</b>? (pause) <b title='Joey is stupid'>I heard it</b>.<br>
(Chandler runs to the window, opens it, starts out, but returns, <b title='casual - relaxed'>casually</b> walking back to his chair.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah, I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen, with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.<br>
<i>Kevin</i>All right. It's no big deal.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah. Just out of curiosity <b title='however'>though</b>, which one of you was for me?<br>
<i>Kevin</i>That would've been me.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, nice. Different situation, cowboy, you would've had yourself a <b title='sb who is difficult to manage or control'>handful</b>.<br>
<i>Bill</i>So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um-<br>
<i>Bill</i>Then, can I have your number?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(pause) I'm sorry, no.<br>
<i>Bill</i>Ok. (They start to walk away.)<br>

<i>Rachel</i>Ah yeah, we had a moment. We looked at each other. Maybe if we live together for another 10 years, we may hold hands!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>But you were really excited about it. Don't you wanna talk to him or...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No. No, <b title='because'>'cause</b> I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."<br>

<i>Mike</i>Uh, no. I just left. Oh, and that, right there, is the most interesting conversation I've had all night.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Really? Ok, well, you have to go back in.<br>
<i>Mike</i>Wha...? Go back? To the "land where time stands still"?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>I'm so sorry honey, but, ok, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to <b title='stop sb/sth that is going from one place to another from arriving'>intercept</b> all his calls.<br>

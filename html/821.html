<i>Joey</i>I know. Yeah I made 'em all by myself. I-I mixed the <b title='ingredient - one of the foods that you use to make a particular food or dish'>ingredients</b>. I put 'em in the oven I took them out. <b title='used when you admit that sth is true'>Granted</b> I should've used the <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Baking_glove.jpg/220px-Baking_glove.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven_mitt">Wiki</a>]'>oven mitts</b> but still.<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>Ah Monica, my star student.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know, you called me that before so I-I <b title='take the liberty of doing sth - do sth without asking permission'>took the liberty of</b> <b title='fashion - shape/make'>fashioning</b> a star out of <b title='[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil">Wiki</a>]'>aluminum foil</b>. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>(tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum. (Hands the star back.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Wow! A star! (The class <b title='↗glower, stare, gaze, glimpse, glance, gawk'>glares</b> at her.) I know you all <b title='dislike very much'>hate</b> me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.<br>
(The teacher goes to Joey's station.)<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>Ok Joey, you're <b title='being considered, under study'>up</b> next. (Tries one of his cookies.) My God, this is amazing! You get an A!<br>
<i>Joey</i>I get an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I'm a <b title='nerd, geek, ↗bookish (more interested in studying and reading books than in taking part in physical activities), -ish'>dork</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Joey! I'm so proud of you!<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>I think you should give him your star.<br>
<i>Monica</i><b title='said before disagreeing with sb'>Excuse me</b>? He doesn't even know what he's doing!<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>We're all <b title='↗rookie, amateur, pro, veteran'>beginners</b> here. Nobody knows what they're doing.<br>
<i>Monica</i>I do! I'm a professional chef! (The class <b title='gasp - breathe in suddenly'>gasps</b>.) Oh relax! It's not a <b title='=legal drama [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtroom_drama">Wiki</a>]'>courtroom drama</b>!<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>If you're a professional chef, what're you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review...<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!<br>
<i>Monica</i>You do?<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little...<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>Very much.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok then, I don't <b title='be bad ↗suck'>stink</b>. I'm a good chef. Ok. (Starts to leave.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't wanna go. I'm having fun.<br>
<i>The Cooking Teacher</i>Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)
<s>An Office Building, Chandler is on his interview.</s>
<i>Chandler</i>...also I was the <b title='sb who is in the most important or leading position in any activity'>point person</b> on my company's <b title='change, or the process'>transition</b> from the KL-5 to GR-6 systems.<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>You must've had your hands full.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>That I did. That I did.<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>So let's talk a little bit about your duties.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to <b title='make a joke, say sth humorous'>crack a joke</b>) All right.<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>Now you'll be <b title='head - be in control of'>heading</b> a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(trying not to laugh) I see.<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can <b title='put sth somewhere; feces; defecate'>dump</b> a certain amount on them.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(really try not to laugh) Good to know.<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>We can go into detail...<br>
<i>Chandler</i>No don't <b title='please'>I beg of you</b>!<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='happy and relaxed because sth bad has not happened, or because a bad situation has ended'>relieved</b>) Really?!<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did great.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. You know I've been told I <b title='come on strong - show very clearly that you are determined to do sth'>come on too strong</b>, make too many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn't understand) Duties. (Still doesn't.) <b title='doodie - solid waste from the body ↗poo'>Duties</b>! (Still doesn't.) Poo. (Still doesn't.)<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>Poo?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh my God this doesn't <b title='include in consideration'>count</b>! Ok? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the <b title='corridor, hallway'>hall</b>! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!<br>
<i>The Interviewer</i>Poo?!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>I'll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
<s>Ross and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his <b title='romantic meeting'>date</b>.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hi! You're back from your date!<br>
<i>Ross</i>How are you?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, you not like Katie?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! No, she's-she was nice. I mean, she's just a little <b title='↗whore, tramp, -y (having a quality or feeling, like, typical of)'>slutty</b>, but who isn't?<br>
<i>Ross</i>I liked her.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Of course you did Ross, you would date a <b title='<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Male_gorilla_in_SF_zoo.jpg/220px-Male_gorilla_in_SF_zoo.jpg"> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla">Wiki</a>] ↗chimpanzee, ape, guerilla'>gorilla</b> if it called you Indiana Jones!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy <b title='<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone">Wiki</a>'>hormones</b> today?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Why? What was wrong with her?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh, there was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok, so what's the matter?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I don't want you to date her!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Ok? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be <b title="be at sb's beck and call - always be ready to do what sb wants">at my constant beck and call</b> 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, <b title='↗constantly, continuously'>all the time</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.<br>
<i>Ross</i>True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.<br>
(Pause.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They <b title='↗embrace, snuggle, cuddle, huddle'>hug</b>.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Do you feel better?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No, <b title='weaker "no" ↗no way, not so much'>not really</b>. You're pressing the baby into my <b title='the organ in the body that holds urine (waste liquid) ↗kidney'>bladder</b> and now I have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Just, just one thing, umm...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Uh-huh.<br>
<i>Ross</i>We live together. You're-you're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(pause) Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm...<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh-oh, Rach! I was just <b title='mess around - be joking'>messing around</b>! (She's <b title='very surprised/shocked'>stunned</b>) Like you did last night when I had to pee?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just <b title='mess with - joke around with'>messing with</b> you too!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(pause) Ok. Ok. Because for a minute you said you...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh no-no-no-no, no!<br>
<i>Ross</i>...that you actually...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No that's just-(Laughs)-That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!<br>
(They both laugh. Ross sits down, but Rachel doesn't move and is lost in thought.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Rach?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah?<br>
<i>Ross</i>The bathroom?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Right! (<b title='head - go in particular direction'>Heads</b> for the bathroom.)

<i>The Acting Teacher</i>All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between <b title='at or toward the back of the stage in a theater ≠downstage ↗offstage, onstage'>upstage</b> and downstage is?<br>
(No one can and Monica looks at Joey <b title='expectant - having expectation'>expectantly</b>.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)<br>

<i>Joey</i>(Joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!<br>
(Chandler acts disgusted, but is happy that Joey has stopped snoring. However, just as he is about to leave, Joey starts snoring again. So to get him to stop, he slams the door shut, waking Joey.)<br>

<i>Gunther</i>You don't need to fill these silences.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Oh ok, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!<br>

<i>Joey</i>Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. You know, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. You know, they're not gonna get married anyway!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realize what they've done and they're gonna <b title='call off - cancel'>call the whole thing off</b>. <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b>, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Yeah well, I don't dance at weddings.<br>

<i>Ross</i>Noo. Why?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Well, apparently he scares easy.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>It's ok. Sometimes, things don't <b title='prove effective or successful'>work out</b> the way you'd thought they would.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Come here.<br>
(They hug.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(Breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>You ok?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah! I got my girls.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. (Leaves.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe's lap.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(Looks at Monica) Hey, you know what might cheer you up?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What?<br>
[Time lapse, all three girls are now wearing wedding dresses, eating popcorn, drinking beer, and watching TV.]<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know, I gotta tell you, this really does put me in a better mood.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this <b title='continuously'>all the time</b>. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.<br>
(There's a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh God! That's Chandler. He's gonna <b title='make a short visit to a place'>come by</b> and borrow some candles for his big date!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, ok! (She goes to answer the door.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He'll see us!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!<br>
<i>Rachel</i><b title='↗jinx'>You don't gotta marry Chandler</b>!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Not after this!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok, guys, just, relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it's Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the door.)<br>
<i>Joshua</i>I gotta go.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that <b title='ought to'>oughta</b> <b title='have an effect'>do</b> it.
<s>Chandler's bedroom, he is sleeping with Marjorie. <b title='suddenly'>All of a sudden</b>, Marjorie starts talking in her sleep.</s>
<i>Marjorie</i>(Talking in her sleep) Food's here. <b title="used to say that you agree with sb's suggestion or that sth seems reasonable">Fair enough</b>. Fifteen-minute warning. Late. (Starts screaming which <b title='startle - make sb suddenly surprised or slightly shocked'>startles</b> Chandler).<br>
(This all wakes up Joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of Chandler's door, and starts to complain about the noise.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to say, "What's up with that?")<br>

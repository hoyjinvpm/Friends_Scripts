<i>Ross</i>Hey, what's going on?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's <b title='{spoken} quickly'>quick</b>, bring champagne and a <b title='a candy bar [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Musketeers_bar">Wiki</a>] <img src="300px-3-Musketeers-Wrapper-Small-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/3-Musketeers-Wrapper-Small.jpg/300px-3-Musketeers-Wrapper-Small.jpg"'>Three Musketeers bar</b>."<br>

<i>Monica</i>(yelling at the top of her lungs) I'm engaged! I'm engaged!<br>
[Cut back inside.]<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm <b title='↗straight, heterosexual, homosexual, lesbian, come out (of the closet)'>gay</b>! I'm gay!"<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah. No, that guy moved.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Can I bring her in?<br>

<i>Monica</i>Ok! Wait-wait-wait! Ok. Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Ok, umm, I just, <b title='want to'>wanna</b> say that... I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night.

<i>Chandler</i>It's ok, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Awww, come on- wait- stop it. Ok, to Monica.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>To Monica!<br>
(They all say to Monica, <b title='↗click, rattle'>clink</b> their glasses, and drink.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>So have you decided on a band for the wedding? <b title='because'>'Cause</b> you know, I'm <b title='kind of'>kinda</b> <b title='good at or interested in playing or singing music'>musical</b>.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I <b title='↗quizzical, doubtful, dubious, questionable, suspicious, skeptical'>doubt</b> she's even had time to think about...<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well speaking of <b title='chime in - interrupt a conversation ↗barge in'>chiming in</b>, remember the time you burned down my apartment?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(To Monica) Yeah, you're <b title="without anyone's help ↗by yourself">on your own</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>You know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at <b title="The Plaza Hotel [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Hotel'>Wiki</a>] <img src="250px-Plaza_hotel-1.jpg" tppabs="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Plaza_hotel.jpg/250px-Plaza_hotel.jpg">">The Plaza</b>.<br>

Supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone <b title='stop/halt (dead) in your tracks - suddenly stop, esp because sth has frightened or surprised you'>stops in their tracks</b> upon hearing this.) What?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?<br>
<i>Joey</i>You guys don't think I look 19?<br>
(A brief silence <b title='ensue - happen after or as a result of sth'>ensues</b>.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!<br>
(They all politely laugh and stop just as quickly.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok everybody, let's go! Let's go!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Let's go!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok!<br>
(They all leave and Joey comes back in quickly.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>(To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh honey no, you ate it all.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Aw I was afraid of that.<br>
(Walks out and after he closes the door Phoebe turns around and takes a bite out of what is left of his candy bar.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, they're getting ready.</s>
<i>Monica</i>(looking at her hand) You know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You're not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the <b title=' a cover for a bed that is filled with a soft warm material ↗quilt, duvet, bedclothes'>comforter</b> on the bed making a spot for her.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Know what I mean?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yeah, but I don't think we have time.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the <b title='↗groom, maid of honor, best man'>bride</b>. Two hundred people are gonna be looking at you in a clean white dress.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(<b title='lusty - energetic ↗lust'>lustily</b>) Let's do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)
<s>Joey and Rachel's appartment, Joey is looking into a hand mirror <b title='↗pull a face - make strange expressions such as dislike or disgust'>pulling different expressions</b>. Rachel walks in.</s>
<i>Rachel</i>So, <b title='"Magic mirror in my hand, who is the fairest in the land?" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White">Wiki</a>]'>are you the fairest one of all</b>?<br>
<i>Joey</i>(<b title='tired out; exhausted'>beat</b>) Rach, I can still play 19, right?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah but Joey you gotta dress younger. <b title='used for emphasis'>I'm telling you</b> if you wear the right clothes you can look any age.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Really?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you know, I work in fashion and fashion is all about youth.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Fashion is all about me?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>About youth, Youth! <b title="used to tell people to listen carefully">Listen up</b> Grandpa!

You-you-you were probably tired, you <b title='Excessive alcohol use has long been recognised as one cause of erectile dysfunction'>had a lot of champagne</b>, don't worry about it!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(<b title='motion - indicate to sb by a gesture ↗signal'>motioning</b> with his hands) I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm <b title='very interested or attracted by sb/sth ↗intrigued'>fascinated</b>. You know, it's uh, it's like <b title='the scientific study of living things ↗biochemistry, biophysics'>biology</b>! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed biology and tonight biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i><b title='Look at it'>Check it out</b>. Ok, I can play this while the guests are coming in. Ok. (Singing) Twelve years old and <b title='If you say that sb is addicted to sth, you mean that they like it very much ↗alcoholic'>addicted</b> to <b title='↗mutton, lamb, beef, veal'>pork</b>, No one thought Monica would marry.

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so, so you're not <b title='persuaded ↗talk into'>convinced</b>. That's <b title='all right'>alright</b> 'cause I got another one.<br>
First time I met Chandler, I thought he was gay.<br>
But here I am singing on his wedding day!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Phoebe!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.

<i>Rachel</i>No!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oh no!<br>

<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, so The Plaza! Ok, we'll get us some <b title='an alcoholic cocktail based on rum, Curaçao liqueur, and lime juice, associated with Polynesian-style settings.

<i>Monica</i>You know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Why?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...<br>
<i>Monica</i>No-no, I-I really don't wanna talk about it! I don't! (To Rachel) <b title='particularly'>Especially</b> with you. (Goes into her room.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>Psss, that is whack!<br>
[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]
<i>Phoebe</i>(she's <b title='strum - play a guitar or other musical instrument by moving your fingers quickly across its strings'>strumming</b> something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Ok, I think I'll play it at the wedding.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! Well, we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you wanna hear like, like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Wouldn't she?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Would she?<br>
<i>Joey</i>Would she?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Would she? Would she? It's starting to sound like wood cheese.<br>
<i>Joey</i>I could <b title='choose, like'>go for</b> some wood cheese <b title='at the present time'>right now</b>.
<s>Rachel's bedroom, she's <b title='pace - walk first in one direction and then in another many times, esp because you are nervous'>pacing</b> as Ross knocks on her door and opens it a little to <b title='put'>stick</b> his hands in.</s>
<i>Ross</i>Guess who? (Enters fully.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Hey.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff <b title='if sth is up in the air, no decision has been made about it yet'>up in the air</b>...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>What do you think Monica mean when she said I don't wanna talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.<br>
<i>Ross</i>Still thinking about it huh?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (<b title='↗ape, copy, do, emulate, imitate, impersonate, mock, mime, simulate'>Mimicking</b> Monica.) Especially you!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I care!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(tightening his tie) And so do I.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>You know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?<br>
<i>Ross</i>Ok. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Am I going to let you watch me undress?<br>
<i>Ross</i>(sitting up) No! (Exits.)
<s>Monica and Chandler's bedroom, they are both getting undressed.</s>
<i>Monica</i>I can't believe her, you know it's-it's just- it's so typical.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Now, Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to <b title='<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061105081333AAsZ3jX">Where does the tradition of throwing the brides bouquet come from?</a>'>throw the bouquet</b>, and then there's gonna be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.<br>
<i>Monica</i>Paris?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>We will take a <b title='lit by the moon'>moonlit</b> walk on the <b title='The rue de la Paix is a fashionable shopping street in the center of Paris. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_de_la_Paix,_Paris">Wiki</a>]'>Rue de la</b> (<b title='mumble - say sth too quietly or not clearly enough ↗incoherent, unintelligible'>mumbles</b> something).<br>
<i>Monica</i>Keep talking.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I love you!<br>
(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(in French) <b title='Hello, sir'>Bonjour, monsieur</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Ok, don't say anything, you might scare it away.<br>
(There is a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>It's Paris, who knows we're here!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what's up? (She enters.)<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Ok, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small <b title='payment of a part of a larger sum, the rest of which is to be paid later ↗down'>deposit</b>.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What?!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, just some <b title='honest and sincere intentions. When buyers execute a purchase contract, the contract specifies how much money the buyer is initially putting up to secure the contract, to show "good faith," and how much money all together will be deposited as a down payment. The balance is generally financed as a mortgage or a combination of mortgages.'>good faith</b> money to <b title='=save/keep the date'>hold the date</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)<br>
[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)<br>
<i>Joey</i>They break your heart, don't they?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>You know, I don't really need their permission.<br>
<i>Joey</i>Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>What?! What's wrong with my eyes?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>They <b title='give away - show where sb is or what they are doing or thinking when they are trying to keep this a secret ↗turn in, tell on'>give you away</b>! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on them for like 15 minutes.<br>
<i>Joey</i>And that'll get rid of my wisdom?<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>Maybe just 10 minutes for you.<br>
[Cut back to Monica and Chandler's room, they are making out again as there's another knock on the door.]<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!<br>
(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>Yes.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, what did you mean <b title='at an earlier time ↗then'>before</b> when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?<br>
<i>Chandler</i>What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Ok, bye-bye!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?<br>
<i>Monica</i>Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Wh-?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>(To Rachel) Hey, here's a thought.<br>
(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, what are you talking about?<br>
<i>Monica</i>My <b title="a party thrown in honor of a girl's sixteenth birthday [<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_sixteen_(birthday)'>Wiki</a>]">Sweet Sixteen</b>! Remember, you went to <b title='first base - kissing; second base - getting felt up (touch sb sexually); third base - giving hand job etc; home run - having sex'>third base</b> with my cousin Charlie.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(entering) Ahh, third base.<br>
<i>Monica</i>It's all everybody at the party could talk about!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, you know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!<br>
<i>Monica</i>(gasps) We had a <b title='A caricature is a rendered image showing the features of its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/MattCaric.jpg/220px-MattCaric.jpg">'>caricaturist</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh!<br>
<i>Phoebe</i>(singing, angrily)<br>
Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing?<br>
Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!<br>
(Exits.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.<br>
<i>Monica</i>And <b title='still ↗yet again - one more time after there have been many other times'>yet</b>, here we are doing it again.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ugh, Monica, I don't wanna steal your stupid thunder!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh <b title='said when you think what sb has just said or asked is not possible or reasonable'>please</b>! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!<br>
<i>Ross</i><b title="(you've) got me (there) - used to say you do not know the answer to sth ↗sarcastic">Got me</b>. (He shows of his hands.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right, easy <b title='mime + y. mime - the use of movements to express what you want to say without using words. -y - having a quality / tend to do sth'>mimey</b>, the moment has passed, it <b title='am/are/is/has/have not'>ain't</b> gonna happen!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>I swear, I never wanted any part of your night! No one was supposed to see us kissing!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!<br>
<i>Ross</i>Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm <b title='call off - cancel ↗put off'>calling it off</b>.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) <b title='↗way to go'>Way to</b> save your <b title='↗indignity, humiliation'>dignity</b> my man.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why, would I ever want to <b title='reduce the positive effect or success of'>take away from</b> your night?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I don't know! I don't- maybe you're feeling a little <b title='feeling angry and upset about sth that you think is unfair =bitter'>resentful</b>? Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formerly <b title='↗plump, chubby, skinny, slender, slim'>fat</b> friend is getting married before you!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Oh wow. That- you know what? That is so unfair. You know what? Now I wanna steal your thunder! Come on, Ross, let's go have sex!<br>
(Ross tries to <b title='refuse to accept ↗reject, turn down'>dismiss</b> it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows Rachel.)<br>
<i>Monica</i>(yelling after them) I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)<br>
[Cut to Rachel's bedroom.]<br>
<i>Ross</i>Look uh, if we're gonna do this...<br>
<i>Rachel</i>We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doing it.<br>
<i>Ross</i>I see, so everybody wins.<br>
(There's a knock on the door.)<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Who is it?<br>
<i>Monica</i>(outside the door) It's Monica, <b title='open ↗hang up, write down, help out'>open up</b>!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Ok well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she <b title='poke - quickly push your finger or some other pointed object into sb/sth ↗pinch'>pokes</b> him.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>Oww!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica <b title='↗storm out'>bursts in</b> followed by Chandler.) May we help you?<br>
<i>Monica</i>I just wanted to say that I hope you <b title='used for emphasis'>do</b> have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm <b title='↗consummate, knock up, conceive'>pregnant</b>!<br>
<i>Chandler</i>How is that ever going to happen?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>All right Monica, do you wanna know why I was with Ross tonight?!<br>
<i>Monica</i>I know why!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>No you don't know why!<br>
<i>Monica</i>Ok! Why?!<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Because! Because I was sad.<br>
<i>Monica</i>What do you mean?<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just <b title='↗ring a bell, recall, recollection'>reminds</b> me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!<br>
(Ross looks at Chandler.)<br>
<i>Chandler</i>(To Ross) I don't care, she slept with me.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.<br>
<i>Monica</i>(starting to cry) I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)<br>
<i>Ross</i>(<b title='sounding and looking completely serious'>deadpan</b>) Well, I'm gonna <b title='leave'>take off</b>. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.<br>
<i>Chandler</i>Thanks.<br>
<i>Ross</i>(at the door) And uh, Rachel.<br>
<i>Rachel</i>Yeah.<br>
<i>Ross</i>What can I say, you missed your chance. <b title='starting from the present time ↗as of/from, ever since'>From now on</b> the only person who's gonna enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes <b title='↗imply, masturbate, ambiguous, equivocal'>what he said</b> and exits <b title='disgust - make you feel extreme dislike or disapproval'>disgustedly</b>.) (Chandler looks at his hands and then exits. Rachel and Monica hug).
